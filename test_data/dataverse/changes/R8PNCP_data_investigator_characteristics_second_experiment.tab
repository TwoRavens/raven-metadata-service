My coworkers and I stayed late without overtime all the time. Customers were arrogant, didn't treat us like people but rather like servants.

People would demand that they get special treatment and sometimes they got their way while treating us like crap - pushing our closing to 11 pm instead of 10.

At least enough to compensate for the dehumanizing aspects of the job. I worked full time at one job and it covered my expenses but I never had a chance to save up even for an emergency fund. I never paid for food because I got leftovers from the Kitchen. The grocery job put expired items in the break room fridge so there was that.

I went to vote to find that I was no longer registered...in the county I had been registered in for 25 years!!!!!  I was registered in another county over two hours away,  I got copies of the fraudulent registration.  They had my social security number.  The address used was a vacant lot, according to google maps.  The registration was done through the welfare department.  It was signed with my name...not my signature...and it was almost totally unreadable.   It took me almost 2 years to straighten the mess out.  By then, they were claiming that there was a woman in that town that had a social security number that had the same last 4 numbers as mine.  I reminded them that they had sent me a copy of the fraudulent registration from and that it had my social security number on it.  They never did anything about this.  I will always believe that the dems in the registration office and the welfare office had something to do with it.",
