Though the moderate SDP gained seats from 5 to 8, the nationalist separatist Serbian SNSD and SDS also increased their seats to 8 and 4 respectively. It is difficult to tell whether these elections were a triumph for ethnic nationalists, or moderates. The ethnic breakdown is as follows. Bosniak: In the previous elections held in October 2006, the then Prime Minister Adnan's Terzic Party of Democratic Action (SDA) won nine seats, followed by the Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina (SBiH) with eight.  In 2010, the SDA took 7 seats while SBiH took 2.  Serb: In 2006 the Party of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in Serbia took seven seats while the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) took three seats. The SNSD\u0092 election campaign demanded for a split of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia Herzegovina. In 2010 SNSD took 8 seats, the SDS took 4. This indicated an increase in nationalist, separatist sentiment in Serbia.  Croat: In 2006 the Croatian Democratic Union-Croatian National Union (HDZ-HNZ) took three seats. The Croatians Together (HDZ 1990), comprising dissidents of the HDZ, took two seats. In the 2010 campaign, the HDZ called for an autonomous region for Croats and was in a partnership with the Serbian SNSD to support each other's calls for greater independence. The 2010 results gave HDZ 3 seats, and HDZ 1990 2 seats (no change from 2006).  Moderate: The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDP), is the only major party that draws support from all three ethnicities: moderate Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. The SDP took 5 seats in 2006, and 8 seats in 2010. This potentially implied an advance for moderate parties, but was countered by the gains of Serbian nationalists.",
