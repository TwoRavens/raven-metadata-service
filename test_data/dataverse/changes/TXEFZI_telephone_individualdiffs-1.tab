          "Hey friends, I just saw the names of the 2016 presidential candidates and the list was pretty interesting. I thought that the most interesting names were Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. It would be interesting to have a female run America. That would be very historic. Donald Trump has no business running for President. He would just make America fall apart. ": 1,
          "I think Bernie Sanders is going to give Hilary a run for her money, he's further left than she is, and I think she'll have to travel more left to stand a chance of getting the democratic nomination. ": 1,
          "The candidates for the 2016 presidential election run the spectrum from very conservative to some of the most liberal people to make headlines. In addition to the first real female contender for the presidency, we have business leaders, lifetime politicians, as well as some candidates that are riding on the coattails of others.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates and so much information going on that it is hard to keep up.": 1,
          "The 2016 election is filled with people both known and are new to most voters.": 1,
          "I am really not impressed with the group of candidates for 2016. I am having a hard time finding who to support. I really don't understand where they stand on the issues.": 1,
          "There are basically two democratic candidates that we have heard about, Clinton and Sanders.  Neither good choices, a socialist or a fraud.  Unfortunately the republican ticket is too crowded, thus not yet creating a united front.  Muddying the waters is Donald Trump, who seems to have nothing good to say about others from his party.": 1,
          "Bernie sanders is a candidate who is running for president and some people like him.": 1,
          "The 2016 election is going to be interesting. With Trump and Hillary Clinton both in the race, it will be like a three ring circus. ": 1,
          "Hello All, the candidate with policy views closest to my own opinions is Bernie Sanders. I cannot imagine someone like Donald Trump being elected and consider him there only for the entertainment value. Overall I think either Hillary Clinton or Jeb bush has the best chance of election.": 1,
          "When thinking about who to vote for in the 2016 presidential election I would urge you to vote for the person who will help you and the country the most. Look at who will directly help you and who will point the country in the right direction. The past is usually a good predictor for the future so look at who we, as a country have flourished under, and vote for the who will give us a best chance to thrive.": 1,
          "There are many candidates in the field this election season. It is more important than ever that voters do independent research and choose the candidate that best represents their values, rather than the candidate with the most expensive campaign.": 1,
          "I WILL SUPPORT ONLY NO NONSENSE CANDIDDATES": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates for the 2016 presidential election. There are more Republican candidates than Democratic. Each one has different qualifications (and some, like Donald Trump, have seemingly none, yet are polling very well). There is some competition between the Democratic candidates, and many are specifically pitting themselves against and criticizing Hilary Clinton.": 1,
          "Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are running on the Democratic side.Joe Biden may or may not be running. On the Republican side Jeb Bush and Donald Trump are running.": 1,
          "I think the 2016 presidential race will be interesting. I am still not sure who I am going to vote for but I know that there are some presidential candidates act like clowns. This is a very responsible job and anyone who votes should understand this. The future president will represent the whole country and I think that's how presidential candidates should act.": 1,

          "There are a lot of wack jobs running for President. That is no suprise. They all are talking a great game now, but when it comes down to it they are all just blowing smoke at us. A lot of them are already politicians and they know the ins and outs of doing what it takes to get votes. I am interested to see the things they spew at the debates, because right now I do not see a real stand out that I believe will turn this sinking ship around. Most of them have little concept of the working class America or the quality of life these hard-working people live.": 1,

          "There will be a presidential election on 2016. at this time there are a few democrats and many republicans running for president. while not as diverse as the last presidential election it does cover people from many parts of the country. with so many republican candidates it looks like they will have the most trouble being picked to run for president.": 1,
          "Bernie Sanders is going to kick some ass, and Ted Cruz is an idiot.": 1,
          "Lets be real guys, Hillary is the best there is. The other candidates don't hold a candle to her.": 1,
          "There seems to be way more candidates on the republican side because I think most on the democatic side know who is going to get their nomination": 1,
          "I don't think the race for president will be very climactic. Hillary Clinton is certain to win the Democratic nomination, with Bernie Sanders as her only competition. Sanders does not have enough support to defeat Clinton. For the Republicans, there are a lot of pretty standard candidates. Given their history, it seems that a moderate like Jeb Bush would end up with the nomination, or a standard, more conservative establishment type like Scott Walker. Both are pretty typical Republicans. At least Donald Trump will keep things entertaining.": 1,
          "I feel that we must make the right choice and carefully examine the republican party a little more. The Republican party has too many candidates and we must look through them all to make the best choice. The other members of the Democratic party are not a good choice.": 1,
          "It's hard to choose a specific candidate. These past few elections so many promises are made only to be altered. They just want to get as many votes as they can to get chosen and make false promises.  Be very careful. Ask questions. Ask for proof. Don't just accept what is said. Ask for progress reports. One can say a lot and do nothing.": 1,
          "Bernie Sanders has a great chance of being the Democratic representative, many people believing that he will beat Hilary Clinton. The Republican party is being made a joke with the likes of Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, and Donald Trump.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates right now for the upcoming presidential election. I hope that they focus more on domestic issues this election cycle than international issues like Iran. ": 1,
          "I know Trump has been in the news a lot and people are interested as to how far it will go. However, don't vote for him because you think he is entertaining. Do you really want him to run the country? Make sure you research and vote for who you believe is the best candidate.": 1,
          "While neither party is stellar, clearly Democrats should continue to be elected back into office. The hate and vitriol from the Republican party is counterproductive and frankly frightening. Please at least consider Democrat before Republican.": 1,
          "one has the right ideas but not that popular, two candidates are just what we've had before, and the fourth has no idea of whats going on outside of his bubble.": 1,
          "More than a dozen Republicans and a handful of Democrats have announced they are running for their party's 2016 presidential nomination. I plan on voting for Hillary Clinton for president.": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential field is a large one adn full of diverse ideas as to where this country is and where it needs to be in the future. It has extreme candidate on both sides, from Bernie Sanders to Donald trump and everythign in between. I urge you to decide what issues are important to you and to then choose the candidate that will best fulfill your expectations.": 1,
          "It's still over a year away, but it never hurts to get informed on the candidates early so you can follow the top few you are interested in to see if anything changes regarding your opinion on who is best to vote for based on any new information you get.": 1,
          "I believe that there are a lot of qualified candidates for the 2016 election. My main hope is that Hillary Clinton is not nominated. She will tear down this country just like Barack Obama has. I believe that we need to turn to the Republican Party. I am in high hopes that the Republican party will bring this nation back up to its greater glory. The united states used to be a free and great country. Lets choose someone that can help the United States instead of hurt the american people.": 1,
          "Dear friends,  There are many presidential candidates for the 2016 election.  Are any of them worth the position of President?  I cannot answer that question, but I ask you to do your due-diligence before casting your vote.  I know America moral, strong leader who can lead America to a better tomorrow.  Use your vote wisely and put the best man or woman in office. ": 1,
          "I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CHANGE THE US FOR THE GOOD.": 1,
          "The better democrat is Bernie Sanders as his values never changed. He is an ethical person since he became a politician.": 1,
          "Some of the guys running for the republicans are just not as qualified or as well suited.There seems to be a dozen or more running.It will be nice to see that number decrease in the primaries.": 1,
          "There are a lot of really bad candiates out there. A lot of people who aren't work a vote. It's important to understand that very few are qualified and even fewer will do a good job. It's our job to pick our nations leader. I believer that to be Bernie Sanders.": 1,
          "It is difficult to even think seriously about the 2016 election because the pool of candidates is so ridiculously large.  By the time we actually get around to the election people either won't care or won't remember who is who and that is probably part of why Donald Trump is getting so much ettention.  He definitely stands out from the rest.": 1,
          "Please vote for someone who is genuinely looking out for the interests of the people who are living in the United States and not for someone who is interested continuing representing the interests of the corporate world.": 1,
          "To my fellow family members. I urge you to read up on the presidential candidates on who can truly change the country around for the better. We need someone who is conserative and will leave this country in a good spot for our children. ": 1,
          "It is so unfortunate that Donald Trump decided to run for President. While he has somehow amassed a large amount of money, he is too outspoken, rude, ignorant and opinionated to lead this nation. It is so sad that many people can not see through his lack of knowledge and are swayed by his big mouth.  It was so rude of him to belittle John McCain's war record.  How dare someone who didn't serve in the armed services think he has the right to criticize someone who did.": 1,
          "I am unsure what to write but if you vote, vote democrat.  The dem's are for the people while the republics are for themselves.  If you want anything worthwhile, accomplished, you have to go dem's.  Seriously, why vote for a party who's values are all fake and about control.  Do you think it is a coincidence that they target religious people and people from the south.  They target people who are most likely to be controlled.  Remember, a vote for a republican is a vote for the corporation that owns them": 1,
          "There are more republicans running than democrats. Its funny because even though Donald Trump has no experience he seems to be well liked due to the circumstances in today's news. Also Hilary Clinton seems to be well talked about for the democrats.": 1,
          "There are several people running for president of both Republican and Democratic parties.  There are even some who are of another party (often called independent).  Unfortunately the ones that are getting the most press are the ones we do not want elected.  Please research the candidates before you decide, and select one that is more honorable than the ones in the public eye.": 1,
          "Bernie Sanders is the only candidate you should seriously consider.": 1,
          "we need to look over all the options available and evaluate what the good and the bad so that we make the right choice in the 2016 election not just 1 thing that is good about the candidate ": 1,
          "The candidates were pretty terrible for all parties this year. The republicans are all racist piece of crap and the democrats are racially ambivalent at best. Think we might be going back to the era where black concerns and representation are ignored.": 1,
          "hey guys i think we should all vote forbernie sanders": 1,
          "Hey! I'm excited for this upcoming presidential election. My personal favorite is Hilary Clinton and I think it's time to get a female into the white house and make a change. I remember when her husband Bill took office, it was some of the best times for our country!": 1,
          "In the 2016 presidential election we get reguratated candidates from previous families involved in politics. We get another bush and clinton running against each other. It is like voting for the best of a bad situation. We really need new candidates to bring new ideas and not power hungry families with the same tired ideas.": 1,
          "The election lacks anyone that would make any great change.": 1,
          "There are some decent candidates this time around, way better than 2012. You should really register to vote this year. There's Hilary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and my personal favorite, Donald Trump.": 1,
          "I am not sure about this year's candidates.  I don't know enough about them.": 1,
          "It looks like only the Republicans are being targeted. ": 1,
          "Hey folk 2016 presidential candidates are up. I see alot of potential candidates. It look like Hillary Clinton will be hitting it hard this year and Jeb Bush is another front runner. I can't believe that Trump is running again. The last thing we need is someone like Trump making the rich more rich and the poor even poorer. I will put my money on Hillary I don't agree with everything she has to say; but compared to the rest of the candidates. She is alot more moderate than most.": 1,
          "The three candidates in 2016 all are relatively liberal, with some being far left-wing and others more moderate. All support government and corporate welfare.": 1,
          "I think that Hillary Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election. The republicans do not have very strong candidates and they are too divided. I think the democrats will rally around Clinton. However i do not know that much yet about who is running and their platforms. ": 1,
          "We certainly have a wide variety of candidates here. Use your best judgement!": 1,
          "I haven't really research politics or the elections so I don't have an informed opinion to share.": 1,
          "Hi there, This upcoming 2016 election is going to be exciting to say the least, as we have waited 8 years to make a real change now.  Democrats seem to be putting all their eggs in Hillary Clinton's basket.  Meanwhile there are many Republicans to choose from, like Rand Paul, Donald Trump, or Ted Cruz, to name a few.  There are many more to look into as well.": 1,
          "I think Donald Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy should not be taken seriously. He hasn't proven himself to be a voice for the people only for those that are one percenters. ": 1,
          "Please don't vote for any liberals. We need a smaller federal government, not bigger.": 1,
          "All the candidates on both sides are jumping in right now. Can't wait to see what the GOP has on Hillary. Sure wish Mitt was in the race.": 1,
          "I don't think any of the current candidates for the 2016 presidential race are very good choices on either side of the isle. I think we're more picking the least bad option instead of the best option. ": 1,
          "We are a long way from when it matters. there are too many candidates right now": 1,
          "I think it's a sad crew of folks running, especially on the republican side.  Let's just elect Hilary, a not wonderful choice but the best of the bunch, and get on with things!": 1,
          "Today, the presidential landscape looks filled with lots of choices. Many of these candidates seem to be clamoring for position within their respective parties and they have lots of differing viewpoints of the hot button issues that Americans are talking about. In summery, as of right now, one has many to choose from and as time goes on, we will see a very interesting campaign season.": 1,
          "I love how Trump is entertaining, and how Bernie Sanders is bringing important liberal issues to light. But this is over a year before the election, so don't count on either being on the ticket November 2016.": 1,
          "I would advise you to really do your homework regarding the 2016 presidential candidates. There are a few candidate - Democrats - that I am hopeful for, such as Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders have peaked my interest. As for the Republican candidates that I would like to do more research on are: Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Lindsey Graham. The lists are intimidating and impressive.": 1,
          "I agree that the candidates for the new election are terrible": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential election appears like it will be a repeat of elections from the recent past in which it culminates in a choice of the lesser of two evils.  The candidates all seem out of touch with the concerns of the silent majority, and none seem willing to work for the greater good.": 1,
          "it doesnt matter who you pick the outcome will still be the same and its all lies to get elected. every politician simply has to do what pleases the people who helped them get elected": 1,

There aren't really any exciting candidates who would bring new ideas to the table, with the exception of fringe candidates like Bernie Sanders or maybe Rand Paul, so I don't think there's much chance of any huge systemic changes being made after 2016, regardless of who is elected. In all likelihood, the Democratic nominee will be Hillary Clinton, so the real question is who will make it to the finish line on the Republican side. It's hard to say for sure at this early stage, with Donald Trump leading the polls presently, but if I were to guess, I'd say that someone like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker, or maybe Marco Rubio, will probably be on the final ballot in 2016. It's really hard to say at this juncture.": 1,

They represent more of the same old Washington and more benefits for the rich, and more hardships for the poor. The Democrats have a much better spread.

Then there are more Republican candidates throwing their hats in the ring than ever before. Our country always seems to be divided down this invisible line of liberal and conservative which doesn't actually exist. The big issues will make or break a candidate. Our country needs experienced leadership.": 1,

We need a strong consumer advocate and someone concerned about the smaller and smaller piece of the economic pie that workers are getting and we need a candidate that will not rashly involve us in foreign wars and countries without clear and compelling evidence that it is necessary to defend our country. Bernie Sanders is that man.  Unlike Jeb Bush he has been a consistent critic of the financial institutions, an opponent of the Iraq war and an advocate for the common man.  Unlike Walker he is not the favorite  puppet of a billionaire and advocate of big business.  Unlike Hillary is not tied to the bureaucratic Presidents of the past or a failed Secretary of State who was asleep while the middle east fell apart.": 1,

A lot of them are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire,and taking advantage of Twitter for political support. Jeb Bush sold his shares in his companies and cut ties with his charities. Hilary Clinton stepped down from her role in her own charity but is leasing two floors in Brooklyn (not bad for someone who was \\\\\"broke\\\"\\\"). Donald Trump is expected to take place in the Republican talking thing, and Mike Huckabee left his show to pursue the presidency (but I hated his Christmas book, so won't be voting for him!). Biden won't be running apparently, and Bernie Sanders thinks he has a shot under a socialist platform.\"": 1,
          "The Democrats have a wide variety of candidates - the forerunners are Hilary Clinton, of course, and Bernie Sanders. As far as the Republicans - we have another Bush contender as well as Ted Cruz and Chris Christie, both of whom have been in the media a lot before. ": 1,

          "Have you been keeping track of Donald Trump's campaign? He really is a clown. It's terrifying that he is proving to be more popular among the right-wing crowd than any of the other people trying to grab the republican nomination. Bernie Sanders is more interesting than Hilary Clinton, and I really wish he would win the Democratic nomination. If he did, I think he would have a smaller chance of actually wining the election than Hilary would.": 1,

          "There are a lot of people running for the next POTUS.  As you decide who to vote for in the upcoming primaries, please remember to vote according to your core beliefs.  Hillary Clinton is almost a shoo-in for the Democratic nominee, but she is anti-family, anti-Bible, anti-God, anti-republic, anti-capitalism.  Is that who you really want running our country?  Look at the Republicans.  Who are they? What do they stand for, spoken and unspoken?  ": 1,
          "There is the whole lot of people that are running for President in 2016.  With the exception of Bernie Saunders (And Elizabeth Warren who is NOT running), I wouldnt elect any of these clowns as President.  Heck, I'd give Romney a second look if this is all we have to chose from. ": 1,

          "As you all know, I have decided to support Hillary Clinton in 2016. While I don't necessarily love everything she stands for, in my opinion she has the experience and I like the fact that she is married to Bill Clinton. I really liked it when he was president. I think one of the great advantages she has is that she understands how the system is run in Washington. I think that has been one of Obama's biggest struggles: navigating the ridiculous system that is politics in Washington. I can't believe the ridiculous characters the Republicans have running so I won't even go into that now. ": 1,
          "So there are a couple good candidates running, like Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul. Way more republicans running than democrats too.": 1,

          "The 2016 Republican candidates are a cluster of right wing extremists from crazy to nuts. Remember that we lived in Florida when Jeb Bush was Governor and he was a hot heat, let alone the brother and spawn of two of our prior four Presidents. Hillary, not so enthusiastic, as I love Bernie and I've been a huge fan for years before it became \\\\\"cool\\\"\\\" to Feel the Bern.\"": 1,

Republican candidate Donald Trump is mired in controversy and while he is presently doing well in the polls, his style of off the cuff remarks may end up leading to trouble. Clinton has lost whatever edge she seemingly had with the emergence of Sanders, but both have a chance at grabbing the nomination.": 1,
          "The potential candidates in the 2016 election are basically familar names related to past politicians. There are no actual good candidates but retreads of past. They will be force fed ideas whether democrat or republican. The candidates are not good though.": 1,
          "I think that the 2016 presidential election should be about moving forward and continuing the progress that obama has started. I think that this can best be done by a democratic candidate.": 1,
          "There are some good candidates and many undeserving": 1,
          "There are way too many Republican cantidates.  I don't know who I am going to vote for.  If they can't decide who is going to represent the party, I am going to vote for Bernie.": 1,
          "Hi ___ Hey election time is quickly coming up.  You know which way I lean, and I know you go the other way but I wanted to encourage you to vote for Hillary.

Although I don't completely believe Hillary Clinton would be the best option, I would choose her over Donald Trump in a second. The Democrat candidates are a bit limited this go round and I hope that changes soon.": 1,
          "There is a handful of people running for the Democratic presidential nomination.  There is a much larger number of people running for the Republican nomination.  It will be interesting how things turn out.  Many will drop out for lack of funding and recognition, and a few more names on either side will be added to the mix.": 1,
          "Hey, So this is my take on the 2016 Presidential race: Bernie Sanders: HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Hilary Clinton: Heaven save us all. Martin O'Mally: Could easily turn into the 2016 version of Barack Obama. As for the Republicans? Ted Cruz: Best guy on the right without a doubt. Smart, clear spoken, and principled. Rand Paul: Second best guy, but there's problems there. His thing with McConnel and his stance on Voter ID is troubling. Conversely, his tax plan is the best thing in the world. Carlie Fiorina: I don't know how to spell her name. She sounds nice, in a very sound bite kind of way, but no one knows who she is and I don't think she has enough name recognition to really have any chance. Trump: He's unserious and just looking for press. He'll drop out long before he'll have to face the music of his taxes being published. Ben Carson: He's okay, but he's not politically savvy enough to survive. In the general, he'd get eaten alive by the press. Scott Walker: Probably third best, but he's almost certainly for amnesty, which means he'll never get my vote. Marco Rubio: Turncoat mother fucker. I'd go on talking about the other 15,000 people running for the Republican nomination, but I'm not getting paid enough for that.": 1

There is scandal after scandal and she acts like she is a queen and no one dare question her. The media because they have obvious and blantant bias towards democrats don't press her to answer questions that she should have answered long ago. Not to mention her screeching \\\\WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE\\\\ she makes me want to throw up.": 1,
          "I agree that the candidates for the new election are terrible": 1,
          "I agree with the previous message. The Republicans, like usual, are fielding a bunch of clowns who have to hope of winning an nomination. In typical fashion, they all go extreme right during primaries because only the rabid crazies vote in primaries. Whoever wins the nomination must then swing back toward the center for the national election. Who else could it possibly be other than Jeb Bush. Other options are idiots like Trump and Huckabee. ": 1,
          "I am not sure about this year's candidates.  I don't know enough about them.": 1,
          "I am not to much into politics but i know its important for us to vote and select our leader. I always lean towards democratic liberal since they mainly look out for the interest of the working class.": 1,
          "I am really not impressed with the group of candidates for 2016. I am having a hard time finding who to support. I really don't understand where they stand on the issues.": 1,
          "I am still looking at the candidates, but so far I like Bernie Sanders. The man has a good message and has been proven to be consistent on his voting and convictions.": 1,
          "I am unsure what to write but if you vote, vote democrat.  The dem's are for the people while the republics are for themselves.  If you want anything worthwhile, accomplished, you have to go dem's.  Seriously, why vote for a party who's values are all fake and about control.  Do you think it is a coincidence that they target religious people and people from the south.  They target people who are most likely to be controlled.  Remember, a vote for a republican is a vote for the corporation that owns them": 1,
          "I am unsure who to vote for in the upcoming campaign Im sure we can both decide together": 1,
          "I believe that there are a lot of qualified candidates for the 2016 election. My main hope is that Hillary Clinton is not nominated. She will tear down this country just like Barack Obama has. I believe that we need to turn to the Republican Party. I am in high hopes that the Republican party will bring this nation back up to its greater glory. The united states used to be a free and great country. Lets choose someone that can help the United States instead of hurt the american people.": 1,
          "I believe there are many unqualified candidates from both parties getting most of the media coverage. There is no candidate in the running so far that gives me confidence about this upcoming election.": 1,
          "I can't believe the Republicans have 16 people running for office and none of them is really a viable frontrunner. I'm curious about how long Trump will stay in front and what else will come out of his mouth. Hilary seems fairly inevitable, even though she really doesn't do much personality-wise for a lot of people. ": 1,
          "I do not believe Mrs. Clinton stands for American values.  She is plagued with scandal, corruption, and maintains a 'holier than tho' presence that drives me crazy.  I want a president that wants to do the right thing because it is moral and just, not because of the special interest money and fundraising opportunities dictate where the wind is blowing.": 1,
          "I don't know anything about the candidates so I have no advice to give.": 1,
          "I don't think any of the current candidates for the 2016 presidential race are very good choices on either side of the isle. I think we're more picking the least bad option instead of the best option. ": 1,
          "I don't think the race for president will be very climactic. Hillary Clinton is certain to win the Democratic nomination, with Bernie Sanders as her only competition. Sanders does not have enough support to defeat Clinton. For the Republicans, there are a lot of pretty standard candidates. Given their history, it seems that a moderate like Jeb Bush would end up with the nomination, or a standard, more conservative establishment type like Scott Walker. Both are pretty typical Republicans. At least Donald Trump will keep things entertaining.": 1,
          "I feel that we must make the right choice and carefully examine the republican party a little more. The Republican party has too many candidates and we must look through them all to make the best choice. The other members of the Democratic party are not a good choice.": 1,
          "I guess who you've been guessing will run will be running. There's a couple of surprises- not really surprises but like...really?": 1,
          "I haven't really research politics or the elections so I don't have an informed opinion to share.": 1,
          "I hope you guys are sticking to your plans and aren't going to flip-flop. I know there's one candidate who sticks to his plans and i greatly respect him for that. One Republican is going to ruin it for the party, that's for sure. Be careful.": 1,
          "I know how much you all hate Hilary, but I'm pretty sure she's got this one in the bag and she has my vote. ": 1,
          "I know Trump has been in the news a lot and people are interested as to how far it will go. However, don't vote for him because you think he is entertaining. Do you really want him to run the country? Make sure you research and vote for who you believe is the best candidate.": 1,
          "I love how Trump is entertaining, and how Bernie Sanders is bringing important liberal issues to light. But this is over a year before the election, so don't count on either being on the ticket November 2016.": 1,
          "I only see a couple of viable candidates. I actually think it is going to come down to Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. I think Jeb Bush will be the best option.": 1,
          "I think Bernie Sanders is going to give Hilary a run for her money, he's further left than she is, and I think she'll have to travel more left to stand a chance of getting the democratic nomination. ": 1,
          "I think Donald Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy should not be taken seriously. He hasn't proven himself to be a voice for the people only for those that are one percenters. ": 1,
          "I think it's a sad crew of folks running, especially on the republican side.  Let's just elect Hilary, a not wonderful choice but the best of the bunch, and get on with things!": 1,
          "I think that all the presidential candidates suck and are all a bunch of conservatives. They never let anyone good run for president. I should be elected president then mybe I could straighten out the mess the gov is.": 1,
          "I think that Hillary Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election. The republicans do not have very strong candidates and they are too divided. I think the democrats will rally around Clinton. However i do not know that much yet about who is running and their platforms. ": 1,
          "I think that the 2016 presidential election should be about moving forward and continuing the progress that obama has started. I think that this can best be done by a democratic candidate.": 1,
          "I think that there is a very diverse field with many candidates with strong backgrounds. We should pay more attention in the upcoming months to make the best choice for the country.": 1,
          "I think that we are going to have an election between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.  Although Trump is the forerunner for the Republicans, he inspires negative feelings amongst most of the populace and Bush will ultimately emerge as the victor in the primaries.  I think it's pretty clear that Hillary will get the nomination for the democrats; there aren't any other viable candidates in their party at the moment.": 1,
          "I think that we need a new leader that is fully engaged in truly making changes in this country.  It seems we've had leadership that simply want to be there as a figure and not for any true change.  My hopes are that in the next electon we have some cadidates that are fired up to make changes and break the cycle of just stting around letting things get worse and worse.": 1,
          "I think the 2016 presidential race will be interesting. I am still not sure who I am going to vote for but I know that there are some presidential candidates act like clowns. This is a very responsible job and anyone who votes should understand this. The future president will represent the whole country and I think that's how presidential candidates should act.": 1,
          "I think the choices in 2016 are very clear, we can choose to turn back the clock and vote for candidates that would forget about the financial turmoil that we went through and reverse the limited measures that have been taken to control big financial companies.  We need a strong consumer advocate and someone concerned about the smaller and smaller piece of the economic pie that workers are getting and we need a candidate that will not rashly involve us in foreign wars and countries without clear and compelling evidence that it is necessary to defend our country. Bernie Sanders is that man.  Unlike Jeb Bush he has been a consistent critic of the financial institutions, an opponent of the Iraq war and an advocate for the common man.  Unlike Walker he is not the favorite  puppet of a billionaire and advocate of big business.  Unlike Hillary is not tied to the bureaucratic Presidents of the past or a failed Secretary of State who was asleep while the middle east fell apart.": 1,
          "I think the presidential election should be interesting.  The Democrats seem to already realize that this is a throwaway election for them and whoever the Republican candidate is will win.  I actually think that it would be interesting to see Trump run, he would give us an interesting race if nothing else.  And he doesn't seem afraid to confront issues that need to be discussed.": 1,
          "I think the upcoming candidates are competent for the most part. A lot if them share the same views but go about it different ways. There are a variety of people running.": 1,
          "I think with the 2016 presidential election coming up it is time for us to think about this countries future. It is obvious what has happened when republicans have been in office. War, spending, and a depressed economy.  It is clear we need to vote democrat.": 1,
          "I think you should really think about who you choose to run the country. Do not choose who is going to be against your cause. ": 1,
          "I want you to know there's going to be alot of new republican faces vying to be the president of the united states. The most contorverisal one and my favorite is Donald Trump. He's outrageous and tells it as it is.": 1,
          "I want you to vote for Bernie Sanders - this is the guy who you may not have known about, but he's got the message that's in line with a progressive worldview that will bring us closer philosophically to such idealistic countries as Norway, Iceland, and Sweden.": 1,
          "I WILL SUPPORT ONLY NO NONSENSE CANDIDDATES": 1,
          "I would advise you to really do your homework regarding the 2016 presidential candidates. There are a few candidate - Democrats - that I am hopeful for, such as Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders have peaked my interest. As for the Republican candidates that I would like to do more research on are: Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Lindsey Graham. The lists are intimidating and impressive.": 1,
          "I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CHANGE THE US FOR THE GOOD.": 1,
          "I would like to tell you about the 2016 candidates. I think that all the candidates on the Republican side are pretty terrible. They represent more of the same old Washington and more benefits for the rich, and more hardships for the poor. The Democrats have a much better spread. Bernie Sanders is a very interesting candidate and is slightly socialistic. One of the things I like about him is he is trying to make college free for everyone, which would be great for education.": 1,
          "In 2016 presidential candidates, I hope candidates are more open to middle-low class citizens. The current issue with lack of jobs is huge to college graduates with tremendous amount of student loan debts.": 1,
          "In the 2016 presidential election we get reguratated candidates from previous families involved in politics. We get another bush and clinton running against each other. It is like voting for the best of a bad situation. We really need new candidates to bring new ideas and not power hungry families with the same tired ideas.": 1,
          "It doesn't matter who you vote for. Whole system is corrupt. It will still stay corrupt no matter who wins.": 1,
          "it doesnt matter who you pick the outcome will still be the same and its all lies to get elected. every politician simply has to do what pleases the people who helped them get elected": 1,
          "It is difficult to even think seriously about the 2016 election because the pool of candidates is so ridiculously large.  By the time we actually get around to the election people either won't care or won't remember who is who and that is probably part of why Donald Trump is getting so much ettention.  He definitely stands out from the rest.": 1,
          "It is going to be  a tough election in 2016. We are left to choose from a large group of clowns or candidates with familiar names. We need better choices.": 1,
          "It is hard to even think seriously about the 2016 election when the pool of candidates is so huge right now.  They're all blending together and by the time the election actually happens people will be too burned out to care or remember who is who.": 1,
          "It is hard to say who is going to take charge and represent the Republicans in the 2016 election. If they do not get their act together than the democrats are going to win again.": 1,
          "It is important to research and thoroughly look into the candidate that you believe would best for you and the U.S as a whole.": 1,
          "It is so unfortunate that Donald Trump decided to run for President. While he has somehow amassed a large amount of money, he is too outspoken, rude, ignorant and opinionated to lead this nation. It is so sad that many people can not see through his lack of knowledge and are swayed by his big mouth.  It was so rude of him to belittle John McCain's war record.  How dare someone who didn't serve in the armed services think he has the right to criticize someone who did.": 1,
          "It is very important to vote in the presidential election. Individual peoples opinions matter very much .": 1,
          "It looks like only the Republicans are being targeted. ": 1,
          "It's clear that Hillary Clinton will likely be the Democrat's nominee but I'm not sure about the Republicans. It could be someone experienced like Bush or someone new like Rubio. It should be interesting.": 1,
          "It's hard to choose a specific candidate. These past few elections so many promises are made only to be altered. They just want to get as many votes as they can to get chosen and make false promises.  Be very careful. Ask questions. Ask for proof. Don't just accept what is said. Ask for progress reports. One can say a lot and do nothing.": 1,
          "It's not worth paying attention to yet. A couple bigger names with the regular crazy attention grabbers.": 1,
          "It's still over a year away, but it never hurts to get informed on the candidates early so you can follow the top few you are interested in to see if anything changes regarding your opinion on who is best to vote for based on any new information you get.": 1,
          "It's time to make a change!": 1,
          "it's time to take back our country for the regular people. We need to stop the harm being done to us by the corporations and take back our rights. it's time the common man/woman had a say in what is going on in our society. Please vote wisely.": 1,
          "Lets be real guys, Hillary is the best there is. The other candidates don't hold a candle to her.": 1,
          "Look at the yahoos who are the Republican candidates and ask them if they will move our country forward or are just padding their own or their cronies' pockets. Trump is just a circus act. Only Democrats can push our country to more equality and a better future. ": 1,
          "Many people are currently in the running for their parties' nominations for the Presidency in 2016. There are so many involved it's difficult to parse them out. Some are new faces to the national scene, while some names are familiar and have had their chance before.": 1,
          "More than a dozen Republicans and a handful of Democrats have announced they are running for their party's 2016 presidential nomination. I plan on voting for Hillary Clinton for president.": 1,
          "Most of the candidates for the 2016 presidential election are just bogus people wanted to get into the position to gain power and not think of the public as a interest.": 1,
          "My friends, yet again the field of presidential candidates is filled with to the brim with less than desirables. Another Bush? Another Clinton? A self-proclaimed business tycoon? This trio of currently projected front-runners leaves a voter with the dubious problem of voting for the worst of three evils.  We can only hope that in the next 12-months, in God we Trust comes true for our great nation, and out of the pigsty of politics a worthy individual rises out of the myre and muck of Washington, D.C. to finally give our country the leadership we starve for. In the meantime, Tommy Chong will be getting at least one write in vote in 2016. Who's with me, before our country really does go \\\\up in smoke\\\\.": 1,
          "None of the candidates for the upcoming election look good, and trump leading the polls for the republicans is just sad.": 1,
          "one has the right ideas but not that popular, two candidates are just what we've had before, and the fourth has no idea of whats going on outside of his bubble.": 1,
          "Please consider the prior voting records for all of the candidates for president. What have they accomplished so far in their careers?  If you do not have a voting record, what actions have they taken to better the world for you personally.  ": 1,

          "Please vote for someone who is genuinely looking out for the interests of the people who are living in the United States and not for someone who is interested continuing representing the interests of the corporate world.": 1,
          "Rand Paul really has some good philosophical points. I don't think he'll make it past the primaries due to his prickly personality and due to the fact the rest of the world lives on a slightly different planet than him. I applaud him for sticking to his guns.": 1,
          "Republican field is a mess. Over a dozen candidates and no clear favorite. Hillary Clinton is the clear favorite for the democrats and for the election itself. Overall, the candidate pool is somewhat uninspiring": 1,
          "Right now the republicans don't have a clear strong candidate but hopefully one will come to the front in the coming months. Hillary Clinton is the current democratic front runner but is not a good choice for running the country.": 1,

          "Some of the guys running for the republicans are just not as qualified or as well suited.There seems to be a dozen or more running.It will be nice to see that number decrease in the primaries.": 1,

          "The 2016 has too many people running so far.  the republican party has over 15 people running for office.  Most notably lately is the famed Donald Trump who keeps making more and more radical remarks about issues and seems to be getting a growing following.  The big runner is Jeb Bush.  If he wins it will add to the Bush dynasty.  /  / The Democratic side has a few candidates.  Hilary Clinton has a large following and even larger backing from corporations.  Bernie Sanders is seen as the man of the people.  He is running a grass roots campaign and talking about issues that really affect people today.  ": 1,
          "The 2016 presedentail candidate represent a great cross section of America, although the Republican Party is a little more limited in its reach to those other then white men with money. I do not know all of the candidate for the Republican Party, but the one seeming to get the most attention as of late is Donald Trump. He repeatedly seems to seek out the attention he craves and will get it by any means necessary.  /  / The Democratic ticket is being led by Hilary Clinton, who I beleive has a real shot at winning the campaign despite attempts to re-hash settled issues.": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential candidates are similar to past candidates. They all want the same thing - the presidency, of course. It just seems like the same old same old every decade. There doesn't seem to be anyone new or outstanding competing for the presidency this year, not that I can see anyways.": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential candidates is packed full of candidates, expecially republicans.": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential candidates that I am interested are Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. What about you? These two are the most conservative options and would do their best to repair our broken country. Don't even talk about Jeb Bush and Hilary. ": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential election appears like it will be a repeat of elections from the recent past in which it culminates in a choice of the lesser of two evils.  The candidates all seem out of touch with the concerns of the silent majority, and none seem willing to work for the greater good.": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential election will be an important one. It is crucial that we all vote for candidates that have the best interest of all Americans in mind. The candidates running for the presidency of the US are not all qualified for the job, especially those who are more concerned with big companies welfare than ours. Choose wisely and pick the candidate that is working or people not corporations. ": 1,
          "The 2016 presidential elections with be here before we know it. It seems the democratic bid will be going to Hillary Clinton. With her record, I don't believe she is qualified to run this country. The republicans still don't have a strong candidate but maybe in a few months someone will step up. We need a strong leader to get this country going again.": 1,

I urge you to decide what issues are important to you and to then choose the candidate that will best fulfill your expectations.": 1,

Remember that we lived in Florida when Jeb Bush was Governor and he was a hot heat, let alone the brother and spawn of two of our prior four Presidents. Hillary, not so enthusiastic, as I love Bernie and I've been a huge fan for years before it became \\\\cool\\\\ to Feel the Bern.": 1,

The republicans have around 17 candidates as of July 2015, whereas there are only a handful of democrats in the race so far. Leading figures among republicans are Trump, Walker, Perry. On the democrats' side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are both very strong candidates.": 1,

Also Jim Webb is making a run but he does not seem as popular as the other two.   The Republican party has a lot of candidates including old favorites like Huckabee, Santorum, and Rick Perry.  They also have some newer members like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul running.  Their field is very crowded and its going to be interesting watching everything unfold.  ": 1,
          "The Democrats have a wide variety of candidates - the forerunners are Hilary Clinton, of course, and Bernie Sanders. As far as the Republicans - we have another Bush contender as well as Ted Cruz and Chris Christie, both of whom have been in the media a lot before. ": 1,

The group of Democrats running for the White House, on the other hand, is small and homologous, and dominated by Hilary Clinton, who is already assumed to be the future nominee. ": 1,
          "The list of 2016 presidential is pretty broad but also fairly lacking. There aren't really any exciting candidates who would bring new ideas to the table, with the exception of fringe candidates like Bernie Sanders or maybe Rand Paul, so I don't think there's much chance of any huge systemic changes being made after 2016, regardless of who is elected. In all likelihood, the Democratic nominee will be Hillary Clinton, so the real question is who will make it to the finish line on the Republican side. It's hard to say for sure at this early stage, with Donald Trump leading the polls presently, but if I were to guess, I'd say that someone like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker, or maybe Marco Rubio, will probably be on the final ballot in 2016. It's really hard to say at this juncture.": 1,

          "There are 3 candidates running for President in 2016: Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and Bernie Sanders. The field of Republican candidates is littered with indistinguishable artifacts from far-right to right-wing Tea Partiers, evangelical theorcrats, reality show presenters, and future Fox News guest commetators and analysts.": 1,
          "There are a huge variety of candidates so far in the 2016 presidential race. The Republicans have the most, while the Democrats have 2 main forerunners.": 1,
          "There are a lot more Republican candidates than democrats- many of which will run out of funding or are unknown. The democrats are focusing on a few strong candidates while the republicans have many options.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates already, especially on the Republican side! Most of these people hold similiar views on the issues, but a few stand out. Donald Trump pretty much says whatever he wants. on the Democrat side, Hillary Clinton is your typical politician. On the other hand, Bernie Sanders is fighting for the people against the government establishment.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates and so much information going on that it is hard to keep up.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates for the 2016 presidential election. There are more Republican candidates than Democratic. Each one has different qualifications (and some, like Donald Trump, have seemingly none, yet are polling very well). There is some competition between the Democratic candidates, and many are specifically pitting themselves against and criticizing Hilary Clinton.": 1,
          "There are a lot of candidates right now for the upcoming presidential election. I hope that they focus more on domestic issues this election cycle than international issues like Iran. ": 1,
          "There are a lot of names out there right now and both sides have a lot to choose from. The democrats are all but sure who will be the front runner.  We need to strongly research our republican options and put our best conservative foot forward. We cannot afford another Democrat in office.": 1,
          "There are a lot of people running for the next POTUS.  As you decide who to vote for in the upcoming primaries, please remember to vote according to your core beliefs.  Hillary Clinton is almost a shoo-in for the Democratic nominee, but she is anti-family, anti-Bible, anti-God, anti-republic, anti-capitalism.  Is that who you really want running our country?  Look at the Republicans.  Who are they? What do they stand for, spoken and unspoken?  ": 1,
          "There are a lot of poor presidential candidates for the election unfortunately..the democrats are putting up pretty bad people save Bernie Sanders, and the Republicans are just straight up cringeworthy. Do we really want Mike Huckabee or Jeb Bush running this country? Though I am a democrat, I'm not sure if either of those two would be superior to Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is pretty much a republican with democrat backing. All in all, this is a pretty poor election year, I just hope the only person with any brains (Sanders) wins.": 1,
          "There are a lot of potential choices. It is a crowded field at the moment and is mostly made up of Republicans. There seems to be many that are in it just for the publicity, I don't see many of them being real candidates in the end.": 1,
          "There are a lot of really bad candiates out there. A lot of people who aren't work a vote. It's important to understand that very few are qualified and even fewer will do a good job. It's our job to pick our nations leader. I believer that to be Bernie Sanders.": 1,
          "There are a lot of Republican candidates this year and it is very difficult to keep track of all of them. They are all antagonizing each other and make it hard to pick out which one is the strongest. Hillary Clinton looks like the biggest Democratic candidate so far.": 1,
          "There are a lot of wack jobs running for President. That is no suprise. They all are talking a great game now, but when it comes down to it they are all just blowing smoke at us. A lot of them are already politicians and they know the ins and outs of doing what it takes to get votes. I am interested to see the things they spew at the debates, because right now I do not see a real stand out that I believe will turn this sinking ship around. Most of them have little concept of the working class America or the quality of life these hard-working people live.": 1,
          "There are a ton of presidential candidates in the running for the 2016 presidential campaign. The republican field is absolutely packed. There are a few democrats including hillary clinton.": 1,
          "There are a ton of Republican candidates this year, which probably speaks to the general weakness of the candidate pool. It's unfortunate for republicans that there's not a real frontrunner at this point.": 1,
          "There are basically two democratic candidates that we have heard about, Clinton and Sanders.  Neither good choices, a socialist or a fraud.  Unfortunately the republican ticket is too crowded, thus not yet creating a united front.  Muddying the waters is Donald Trump, who seems to have nothing good to say about others from his party.": 1,
          "There are many candidates in the field this election season. It is more important than ever that voters do independent research and choose the candidate that best represents their values, rather than the candidate with the most expensive campaign.": 1,
          "There are many candidates that have taken specific stances on issues which we can judge them by.  There are 2 parties and many politicians within those parties to chose from.": 1,
          "There are many choices when considering presidential candidates for the upcoming 2016 election. The best option, in my opinion, is Bernie Sanders. He's the only one who has consistently stuck by his choices and words in the past. The only other real democratic option is Hillary Clinton, and she has shown in the past that her opinions change with the wind (or more accurately, the money.) When it comes to Republicans, there are many more options than Democrats. But they're all awful. The end!": 1,
          "There are many more Republican candidates on the presidential race.  Many of those running are unknowns or will drop out of the race.  Democrats are focusing on a few candidates": 1,
          "There are many running for president from all kinds of backgrounds.": 1,
          "There are more republicans running than democrats. Its funny because even though Donald Trump has no experience he seems to be well liked due to the circumstances in today's news. Also Hilary Clinton seems to be well talked about for the democrats.": 1,
          "There are several people running for president of both Republican and Democratic parties.  There are even some who are of another party (often called independent).  Unfortunately the ones that are getting the most press are the ones we do not want elected.  Please research the candidates before you decide, and select one that is more honorable than the ones in the public eye.": 1,
          "There are several returning faces running for President in the upcoming elections. Most have been campaigning since early this year and are vying for your attention. Many have begun to embrace social media as well by announcing their intentions and policies over the internet, in hopes of reaching a broader audience.": 1,
          "There are so many people already running, but I feel like I don't know as much about the Democratic candidates as I do the Republican's and yet the Dem side is likely what I'd vote for. Bernie Sanders is intriguing and I like Chafee's stand on war, but I'll have to see how things continue into 2016. Sucks to not be in a state that people care about for polling. ": 1,
          "There are so many presidential candidates running in the Republican Party, 16 so far. They are very different from one another. The front runners are Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio. In the Democratic Party, there are only three that I am aware of. Of course, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and another female whose name escapes me. Hillary is leading the polls but Bernie Sanders has some staunch supporters.": 1,
          "There are some dangeously stupid or corupt folks running for the upcomming election. I usually hate to get too worked up this far before election season, but I believe it is important to start discussing issues before discussing politicians; that might make it easier to weed out the people who are truly in it for the right reasons and represent where we hope the future of our country will head.": 1,
          "There are some decent candidates this time around, way better than 2012. You should really register to vote this year. There's Hilary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and my personal favorite, Donald Trump.": 1,
          "There are some good candidates and many undeserving": 1,
          "There are some interesting choices for the 2016 elections right now. I'm not sure I like any of them. It honestly scares me that someone like Donald Trump is being considered for President.": 1,
          "there are way too many 2016 candidates and donald trump is a jopke": 1,
          "There are way too many Republican cantidates.  I don't know who I am going to vote for.  If they can't decide who is going to represent the party, I am going to vote for Bernie.": 1,
          "There is  a 2016 presidential candidate that is true to his word.  Vote for Bernie!": 1,
          "There is a former governor from Texas, heavily conservative, very much a politician.  The petty billionaire candidate.  The former secretary of state, and wife of a former president.  The brother of a former president, and another candidate who seems to be gaining a grassroots liberal following.  As well as many others.": 1,
          "There is a former Secretary of State who I believe to be a total liar . A billionaire who seems to make a lot of sense on immigration. A Governor from Ohio who turned his state around. And what seems like countless others. Too many to make a good choice at the moment.": 1,
          "There is a handful of people running for the Democratic presidential nomination.  There is a much larger number of people running for the Republican nomination.  It will be interesting how things turn out.  Many will drop out for lack of funding and recognition, and a few more names on either side will be added to the mix.": 1,
          "There is a lot of strong candidates but all in all I do feel like who ever gets elected will be a great president ": 1,
          "There is an oddly large amount of candidates this cycle, particularly republicans. There are only two democratic candidates with a real chance for nomination. ": 1,
          "There is is literally only one good candidate this year. The rest of them are extremely partisan and a lot of them are liars and/or idiots.": 1,
          "There is the whole lot of people that are running for President in 2016.  With the exception of Bernie Saunders (And Elizabeth Warren who is NOT running), I wouldnt elect any of these clowns as President.  Heck, I'd give Romney a second look if this is all we have to chose from. ": 1,
          "There only 4 democrats and a lot of republicans. Some of the same familiar faces Hillary Clinton, Mike Hackubee. I personally hope that Rand Pau will win with his limited government.": 1,
          "There seems to be some candidates about whom I most clearly remember them only attacking other candidates. A lot of them are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire,and taking advantage of Twitter for political support. Jeb Bush sold his shares in his companies and cut ties with his charities. Hilary Clinton stepped down from her role in her own charity but is leasing two floors in Brooklyn (not bad for someone who was \\\\broke\\\\). Donald Trump is expected to take place in the Republican talking thing, and Mike Huckabee left his show to pursue the presidency (but I hated his Christmas book, so won't be voting for him!). Biden won't be running apparently, and Bernie Sanders thinks he has a shot under a socialist platform.": 1,
          "There seems to be way more candidates on the republican side because I think most on the democatic side know who is going to get their nomination": 1,
          "There will be a lot of choice coming up for president.  All have good qualities.": 1,
          "There will be a presidential election on 2016. at this time there are a few democrats and many republicans running for president. while not as diverse as the last presidential election it does cover people from many parts of the country. with so many republican candidates it looks like they will have the most trouble being picked to run for president.": 1,
          "There's somewhat a variety between the candidates this upcoming election -- from socialist to solid right-wing. I just wanted to tell you that we should pick wisely. We should pick the one who is going to continue the initiatives of our current president. We should not pick those who are opportunist, those who think that government is in the interest of businesses. We should think of the people.": 1,
          "This election will be an interesting one, since we have people with all kinds of opinions running this time.": 1,
          "This next election probably won't see Hilary Clinton as the democratic nominee. I feel like her party doesn't even want her running. As far as the Republicans I feel like Donald Trump will probably end up saying too many unfavorable things that will damage his run. I think the best choice for the Republican party would be Ted Cruz or Rand Paul.": 1,
          "This presidential candidate is looking to help the economy by making income more equal.": 1,
          "This presidential election is just like any other. No matter how one says it, the President's job is to be in the limelight for abuse and insults. The real power belongs in the congress.": 1,
          "This time pick a true winner.": 1,
          "This year is an important year for politics. The climate change issue is important and will affect the immediate generations. Perhaps we ought to consider the candidates a little closer this year because a lot is on the line.": 1,
          "To my fellow family members. I urge you to read up on the presidential candidates on who can truly change the country around for the better. We need someone who is conserative and will leave this country in a good spot for our children. ": 1,
          "To put it simply, do not believe the hype from either side. Do not believe anything said in attack ads either. Don't buy into lofty promises. In my opinion, one party consistently puts forth progressive ideas benefiting the largest percentage of Americans, while the other side is mired in old modes of thinking and outdated bigotry. Make the choice for yourself, but look into each side completely on your own without buying into what people tell you.": 1,
          "Today, the presidential landscape looks filled with lots of choices. Many of these candidates seem to be clamoring for position within their respective parties and they have lots of differing viewpoints of the hot button issues that Americans are talking about. In summery, as of right now, one has many to choose from and as time goes on, we will see a very interesting campaign season.": 1,
          "Trying to figure out who to vote for and who would actually do this country some good. It's hard to tell what will be happening soon.": 1,
          "Vote Democrat. Non of the Republicans are any good. Some have even embarresed themselves lately (even with other Republicans). The others have mostly questionable records. I am voting for whomever the Democrats nominate.": 1,
          "Vote for Bernie Sanders, he is the only one who actually practices what he preaches.": 1,
          "Vote for Trump!": 1,
          "Vote wisely.": 1,
          "We are a long way from when it matters. there are too many candidates right now": 1,
          "We certainly have a wide variety of candidates here. Use your best judgement!": 1,
          "We have a lot of choices in the upcoming election.": 1,
          "We have one who I don't really trust, one who made a lot of money that is older, one who makes comments that offend everyone and one who is a name I doubt we want to hear gain.": 1,
          "We need a change in the political system. We need a candidate that actually cares about the people and who will fight for what is best for all. We don't need someone who panders to the rich or the ignorant. We need someone who does not use religion to back any political ideas. Vote for the candidate who fights to make Life better for us all. Bernie Sanders.": 1,
          "We need to elect a person who will make America strong in military and economy. The last 7 years have been an embarassment to the world. The world thinks that we are weak. Our economy is not better except that the rich got richer.": 1,
          "We need to get someone into the white house who actually cares about the United States citizens, and not just about their pockets. This economy is going to get destroyed, and our basic rights taken away, if there isn't someone in office who genuinely cares.": 1,
          "WE need to get the left out of the whitehouse. Whoever finally gets the nod on the right, that's who we need to elect; the next POTUS will have to nominate SCOTUS judge(s) and we need more conservatives on the court.": 1,
          "we need to look over all the options available and evaluate what the good and the bad so that we make the right choice in the 2016 election not just 1 thing that is good about the candidate ": 1,
          "We need to vote for the most conservative candidate that we can to get this country turned around. We can't leave this to our children.": 1,
          "We will have a lot of choices in the upcoming election. Obviously, we have to see who makes it through the preliminaries. Donald Trump has been getting a lot of early election, but we will likely hear from more candidates as we get closer to election time.": 1,
          "What's up buddy,  just wanted to see where you are concerning all of these 2016 presidential candidates.  I don't believe i've EVER seen so many people trying to run.  It appears the democrats have pretty much made up their minds, it's between maybe 3 people and that's a big maybe. The republicans on the other hand....WOW !!  They could start their own football team and join an arena league.  I hope a clear cut leader emerges out of that pack.  If not, it's gonna seem super chaotic until someone does.": 1,
          "When deciding who to vote for, please do not be swayed by buzzwords and soundbites. Please do your research into what a candidate actually stands for - what the candidate has voted for and against, and what the candidates has shown to be their beliefs over time. Vote with what you know, not with what they tell you": 1,
          "When thinking about who to vote for in the 2016 presidential election I would urge you to vote for the person who will help you and the country the most. Look at who will directly help you and who will point the country in the right direction. The past is usually a good predictor for the future so look at who we, as a country have flourished under, and vote for the who will give us a best chance to thrive.": 1,
          "While neither party is stellar, clearly Democrats should continue to be elected back into office. The hate and vitriol from the Republican party is counterproductive and frankly frightening. Please at least consider Democrat before Republican.": 1,
          "While the field is pretty large right now for canidates, there are a few promising ones. I am personally really excited to see how donald trump does. ": 1,
          "With no incumbents running this upcoming election, it looks like it might be a drawn-out one with a contentious round of primaries for the Republicans.": 1,
          "With the field of candidates available, it's optimal that you do your homework and learn as much as you can about them so that you can make an informed decision on election day.": 1,
          "You might not think that your vote will do much to change anything in America, but I really think that any vote really does count. You should consider voting in the 2016 election, but make sure you are knowledgable about the candidates on either side! For example, Hilary Clinton is running! Her husband was president before as you know and she has a lot of experience in politics. She might be a good candidate, don't you think? ": 1,
          "You republicans are all the same - greedy, egocentric, narcissists. And Donald Trump is one hell of a hilarious, sociopathic, Over Fiend.": 1
