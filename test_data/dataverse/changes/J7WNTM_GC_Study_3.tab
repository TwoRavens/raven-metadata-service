Therefore the presence of a capital punishment law could be argued as a deciding factor when other things had been normalized out. /  / I personally didn't buy the argument.   There's a huge bias potential in picking 'adjacent' states, since most states border a number of states, and the urban population normalization strongly suggests that murder rates are much higher in cities in the study than in non-urban areas.  If you're going to compare the murder rates in states, why not do it on a city by city basis, normalizing for size.  Also, the bar chart data clearly shows that there are states with a murder rate with capital punishment that are an order of magnitude greater than some states that do not have such a law on the books.": 1,

Critics claim that though the murder rate fell, the crime rate in all of those states fell as well, and murder makes up a greater percentage of total crime in each of those states.  My biggest complaint is that the study had no true controls.  They did not compare the data they gathered on states that reinstated capital punishment against the rest of the 50 states that did not change their capital punishment laws.  It's conceivable that the murder rate across the country fell, regardless of capital punishment laws.  Second, the study only looked at the murder rate numbers on the year before capital punishment was reinstated and the subsequent year.  To me this seems like a small sample size, and I'd like to see if there were comparable variance in murder rates across other years for each of those states studied.": 1,

          "I don't think that the study provides ample evidence either for or against the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. The main problem I have with it is also the fact that it primarily accounts for the years immediately before and after the adoption of the capital punishment laws. Without looking at a longer period of time (maybe 5 years before and after instead of 1) I don't think any significant conclusions can be drawn. I'm also inclined to agree with the critics of the study that there are also many factors that may have changed in addition to adoption of the capital punishment laws.": 1,

          "I thought the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  This is because the study showed that of the 14 states that had passed the capital punishment law, 11 of them saw a rise in the murder right the following year.  This is all the study focused on, rather than looking at the increase/decrease in the murder rate compared to all other crimes.  Had they done this as well then the study would have been much more fair.": 1,
          "The study indicated that the presence of the death penalty has little or no effect on lowering crime rates. In other words, it's not effective as a punishment.": 1,

          "Most of the reasoning for capital punishment is not that it's a deterrent, but that it does justice to a situation. Arguments about efficacy are typically lost in this highly emotional debate.": 1,
          "it said the crime rate in general dropped significantly in many of the states during the two year period surrounding the change and that murder rates did change, therefore supporting the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "It presented the data in a way that made it appear at first glance that capital punishment was a major deterrent to murder; however it left out several key points that would have made the study inconclusive, in my opinion.": 1,
          "The study definitely doesn't support the hypothesis that capital punishment is a deterrent. While they did find many variations in the crime rate going both up and down in various states, there are far too many other factors that can influence crime rates which should be included in any studies to gain a clearer picture of what effect the laws themselves had. /  / I agree with the initial conclusion that the data as presented is indeterminate.": 1,
          "The study tried to convince you that the research shows the states with capital punishment have higher murder rates.": 1,
          "This is such an amazingly shallow study it makes my teeth hurt. I can't really think of any two states in the US that are so similar that they could be compared in such a brazenly simplistic manner. I could make a strong argument that higher murder rates might encourage certain states to enact death penalty legislation, whereas more peaceful states might repeal their death penalty statute. In this case, the stats would be the opposite of what the researchers found.  /  / The only thing I about for certain about capital punishment being a deterrent is that dead criminals can't commit any more crimes. I can't speak to the rest of society, but I can guarantee that the execution certainly deters the executed.": 1,
          "It seemed that the researchers had a lot of hard evidence (i.e. numbers, figures and charts) that support the notion that capital punishment can deter murder. Even if it isn't direct causation, they could be correlated.": 1,
          "The results show that about the same number of states had the murder number go down as had the murder number go up. The others had the murder number stay the same. No trend stands out about murders increasing or decreasing as a result of capital punishment being reinstated. The evidence just isn't there to support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I think obviously the point of the study was to suggest that murder rates are higher in states where there is capital punishment, at least on average.  Hence, it seems clear that capital punishment does not serve as a deterrent.": 1,
          "Because there were more murders in states with the death penalty than without": 1,
          "The data they report is based on the difference of two years, not very informative. Also the differences appear negligible. They also do a poor job defending or controlling for confounding effects such as the parole restrictions.": 1,
          "Well, they only produced statistics for one year?  That's sort of a big limitation.  And what did they control for in that teeny tiny year?  Crime is usually driven by the economy - that's just a terrible design.  I don't get what the parole changes have to do with anything.  Is the argument that parolees might reoffend with murder?  In a YEAR?  Most folks get rearrested, but many hang on for more than 12 months.  So, I don't get the critique, either.  I'm very opposed to the death penalty - and I think this result is not helpful in the  least.  ": 1,
          "The study shows that, in similar population, having a death penalty is coorelated with having a higher murder rate. This indicates that the death penalty does not deter criminals from murder. Another possibility is that states with a death penalty are more aggressive about crime, and murder rates are higher because murders in their sister states are under-reported. However, this seems dubious as murder is a crime that provokes high emotions from those who knew the victim, and from others who merely have heard of the crime via media. A policeman would be foolish to allow murders to slip through the cracks, although he might get away with not prosecuting jay walkers.": 1,
          "I think it supported capital punishment, however I would much rather see long term murder rates after adoption of capital punishment.": 1,
          "I believe that the factors represented were first ,not sampled long enough ant that more long term follow-up tracking is needed for a more definitive direction.This study was based only on the before and after years represented.Such a result could be merely coincidental. ": 1,
          "I would have liked to know if all people who were sentenced to death were actually put to death. If the state has not put to death all inmates sentenced then that could change how people perceive the toughness of the law.": 1,
          "The study is more to prove there is no gain for capital punishment. What they're trying to show is that killing people has no positive impact on crime reduction. ": 1,
          "The study seemed to support the idea that capital punishment was a bad idea, as the states that allowed it had a upsurge in murder rates.": 1,
          "The authors, Kroner and Phillips,  are clearly opposed to capital punishment. The statistics show that murder rates actually increased in 11 of 14 states after the capital punishment was adopted or reinstated, however, the authors did not look at the fact that crime overall decreased. Moreover, it is impossible to prove an event that didn't happen. In other words, it is possible that the murder rate could have been significantly higher, rather then just slightly higher in those states.": 1,
          "I felt the study supported the argument for capital punishment because the states with the / capital punishment laws had lower amounts of murders.": 1,
          "I think that it was neither supported nor did not support it because the findings were for the most, equal.": 1,
          "There is no evidence to show that these two factors are directly related. Just because capital punishment is the law and crime is higher does not mean that capital punishment leads to higher crime rate. It could mean that higher crime rate leads to acceptance of capital punishment.": 1,
          "It doesn't seem like the research shows capital punishment has an effect on the number of murders": 1,
          "The first study showed that 8 out of 10 states with capital punishment had lower murder rates.  The second study showed similar results with 7 out of 10 states with capital punishment showing lower murder rates.": 1,
          "The study provided rather extensive testing showing that the existence and use of the death penalty is an effective detterent. The filtering down to like demographics seems to suggest that the only variable between the two locations is the presence of the punishment": 1,
          "A quote from the article stuck out to me.  It said something along the lines that if capital punishment was a deterrent then the murder rates would be much lower in states that had the death penalty.  And when looking at the graphs you can see that it is not the case.  The numbers are virtually even in states that have the death penalty and states that do not.  ": 1,
          "The study may have shown a slightly lower rate of murder in states with the death penalty, but it isn't conclusive enough to fully support that the death penalty actually deters crime enough to be persuasive": 1,
          "It did support that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it showed that states with capital punishment had lower murder rates compared to those without.": 1,
          "At first I thought it was convincing for capital punishment, but then when I saw the figures I wasn't nearly as convinced. Yes it dropped some, but not a lot and considering that they didn't factor in other important things, makes it a less credible study.": 1,
          "This type of data seems easy to manipulate.  Despite attempts at demographic consistency, the fact remains that the samples were cherry picked.  Additionally, the fact that death sentences are selectively applied even in states that legally support capital punishment should be taken into consideration when making this argument.": 1,
          "I agree that other mitigating factors could have influenced the study, as the critics claim; however, there has been no data that I'm aware of that show capital punishment is a deterrent to murder or other violent capital crimes.  This study shows that murder rates went up after reinstatement of the death penalty; I believe those statistics regardless of other factors.  ": 1,

          "It shows that there is a small decline in murder rates in some states, but it is pairing the states instead of looking at the big picture. I think if you took into account all states with and without death penalty laws, you would come to the same conclusion.": 1,
          "i don't see why this is bad i think every country should considerate the death penalty.It's only bad for the criminals": 1,
          "Because if it was a deterrent it would be more obvious. The compared states it seemed just had different crime rates, perhaps for other reasons. Maybe year to year those states change. But, if it really was a deterrent it seems that would be slightly more obvious. Although I cannot say the study does much for me either way. Maybe a study over a longer period of time?": 1,
          "The entire study proved an exact split. Twice. Some places just have more crime. It doesn't seem to matter whether there's a death penalty.": 1,
          "The study attempted to support the argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent and I agree with the results because so many of the states saw a decrease the following year. However, the criticism against the study outweighs what the study found.": 1,
          "The study has good points but there are many other factors that probably would figure into a state's murder rates that were not considered in the study - so it would be one argument against capital punishment but not an all-inclusive one.": 1,
          "It did not support the argument that capital punishment was a deterrent to murder because the results were evenly split. If studies conclusively showed lower murder rates in states with capital punishment, it would then demonstrate that it is a deterrent. ": 1,
          "The evidence showed that murder rates were often higher in states with capital punishment, thus it is unlikely that it deters murder": 1,
          "besides a couple of the states researched, almost every state had lower murder rates after adopting capitol punishment. this leads the conclusion that the findings support that capitol punishment is effective at stopping crime.": 1,
          "If the people responsible for the study were to examine different areas, the results could have easily shown that the death penalty was not an effective deterrent. For this reason it seems likely that they chose 10 areas that would support their position of the death penalty being a deterrent.": 1,
          "My view is that if there is no appearant benefit from Capitol punishment as a detterant, it should not be used. The study shows that there is no appearant benefit. And it is believable.": 1,

          "It just seemed that like the study showed that capital punishment could be a deterrent because some states did show  that the crime rate went down.": 1,
          "Because the evidence in the study did not show that there was an overall difference between murder rates in areas that had capital punishment compared with those that did not.": 1,
          "Since this study did not reveal any findings that show capital punishment does in fact affect the murder rate, I believe that capital punishment is not effective, especially in comparison to the ramifications of it. The study would have to show a significant decrease in murder rate to justify capital punishment. ": 1,
          "It supported my viewpoint that independant of moral considerations the death penalty does not have a measurable effect on murder rates as claimed by supporters": 1,
          "This study proves nothing.  The murder rate still maintain the same average (if you considered all 10 states, not 1 at a time).  Other factors need to be factored in and it should be done on a state by state (individual states not a group of states) bases.": 1,
          "According to the research, the murder rate should have been higher before the year of adoption, but it wasn't. Due to this information, I feel the research was trying to point out that capital punishment is not an effective deterrent to murder. However, I don't feel that this research was inclusive enough to sway me any particular way.": 1,
          "Well, it showed the numbers. Apparently there are less murders in states with capital punishment.": 1,
          "I believe that it did not support the argument because it only shows 2 years worth of data.  More data would need to be considered in order to conclusively say that the legislation worked.": 1,
          "The graphs did not provide standard error bars or p-values. By just looking at that graph, there did not seem to be a huge difference between the two types of states. Without seeing the statistical methods, I can not say that it did or did not support capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. Also, I wonder if the study would still look similar if looking at other crimes. In other words,  if you looked at other offenses that led to death penalty, would you see the same results?": 1,
          "I think it could be considered as weak support against capital punishment, but a lot of factors are unaccounted for, as the critics mentioned. There could have been other factors, such as an economic crisis in that year, which affected the rates. In addition, in the 11 states in which the murder rate was higher, it was not much higher. The study does not state if the differences are statistically significant.": 1,

          "As stated in the beginning, the statistically results were uncertain based on a 5 higher, 5 lower and 4 unchanging determination.  Therefore, that particular evidence can not state either yes or now.

I do not place a high level of trust in the validity of this study although it was quite interesting to read about.": 1,
          "I imagine there are many details that lead to the murder rate in some area. I admit I am not versed in the subject, but I don't think this could take \\\\\"everything\\\"\\\" into account. Here's a question, how do the victims families feel about letting the murderer live or perhaps let free again. / I get that many people oppose it. I don't know what the right thing to do is, and I'm glad its not up to me to decide. As far as this study goes, I just find it doubtful that this could be true, or even if it is, that removing the death penalty doesn't sound like it would accomplish anything.\"": 1,

I think if they continued to do evidence throughout many more years then they would have more conclusive evidence.": 1,
          "It is impossible to concretely state that capital punishment is a deterrent especially if we don't know the population of these states, the education funding, the availability of government assistance programs, the availability of guns, etc.  This one measurement does not definitively prove that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,

          "In the majority of cases, states with capital punishment had higher mruder rates than nearby states without it, and even combining the totals among all of the states in the sample group, the murder rate in states with capital punishment was higher. If it were truly to have a deterrent effect, it should be lower- however, more information would help. For example, murder rates in states who have capital punishment over time, from before they had it to now, and for states that don't have it anymore but did in the past.": 1,
          "well if murder rates keep going down then it would be more evidence": 1,
          "The study seems to support the argument because, even though the murder rates in 11 out of 14 states increased after the death penalty was allowed, other factors, especially crime rates, decreased, which means that out of the overall percentage of crime, the increase in murder rates would seem more significant when other crimes decrease.": 1,

Perhaps if every state was taken account for and the results were maintained, the study could be fairly convincing.

When reviewing the data, I noticed the differences between the two states (in the pair) with regard to murder rates was sometimes very small and in other studies may not have qualified as significant enough to be considered a true difference. Therefore, I do not acutally believe believe that argument was supported. There was not enough of a difference between the state pairs to say that the the difference was attributable to capital punishment. The difference could simply be due to natural variation, which needs to be taken into consideration. Some leeway must be given for natural variation and other possible isues.": 1,

": 1,

Besides this fact, I would've like to have seen other crime statistics such as theft, rape, and assualt being included in the study.  That would be my biggest critique; murder is only one crime of many. As a whole it does show that the death penalty doesn't deter murder, which should be self-evident when you look at the motivations for murder.  It's either a crime a passion and the murderer has no care or concern for the reprecussions, it's done for money and again the death penalty doesn't deter hitmen, or it's done because the person is mentally ill and because this person has no concept of right or wrong or gives in to some weird sick twisted desire they again are not detered by capital punishment.

Very little changed altogether, so the study did not support any kind of argument, one way or another.": 1,

These statistics could just be part of a larger trend, or there could be other factors at play here.": 1,

While if the results are true, then maybe capital punishment does not deter murder as much as one would want.  But one can still be for capital punishment even if it is not necessarily to deter murder.  As a person who supports capital punishment, it would be to just empty out prisons, and to give families of victims peace.  I don't think capital punishment does deter murder, but I'm for it.

To say that the only causes for murder rates are the presence or absence of the death penalty and the amount of urbanization is, I think very naive. /  / Not to be too critical, I applaud the researchers for studying this issue and trying to shed more light on it but this is not enough evidence to really conclude anything.

Of course, you can't run controlled trials in an experiment like this, and there could be any number of third factors.

Since the study was replicated using another 10 states, it could be said that 15/?? states have lower rates out of 20 (if i recall correctly). however, after doing some basic research, it could appear that upwards of 32 states have capital punishment. Therefore, it cannot be said that these studies are certainly proving a fact; rather they are testing a theory. Therefore it makes sense that these studies are supporting the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. I think the researchers shouldnt limit themselves to just 10 states, or using 10 \\\\\"different\\\"\\\" states in relation to this. It should really be all 32 states. \"": 1,

I don't recall all of the numbers off the top of my head, but it would seem that if the trend held up, it would equate to thousands or even tens of thousands more murders.  / So assuming it is being offered for this study only...There is too much information that should be taken into account that I was not presented with.

Besides that, the states were split evenly on having an increase, decrease, or stable murder rate so I'm not sure you can draw any conclusion just from those numbers - plus I wasn't sure if the rate of increase was equal or more or less than the rate of decrease in the various states.

Either way, if there is no net benefit to society conferred by the death penalty as the study shows, then there is no reason to risk executing innocent people by mistake.

In addition, the researchers also looked at other elements that could have led to a similar drop in homicides during that time period, and still concluded that, overall, their initial research was correct. Thus, I believe their argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder in the states where it is legal.": 1,

Their sampling of states was small, although the selection of states meeting the criteria is understandably limited, and the results obtained were basically a wash.

There also is a very disproportional amount of Black people in jails, and we just need to do more to address the problems of  Blacks and address racial perceptions.   / I also wish in most instances there could be some therapy, because a lot has to do with environment or brain configuration.

What the study doesn't take into consideration is that many people who support the death penalty don't support it as a deterrent, but as a recompense to those who suffered.": 1,

          "It is inconclusive. It neither supports or undermines the idea. The numbers that are presented were all very close in the pairs of states for murder rates.  / Personally the way that i feel about capital punishment is not based on whether it will keep some one else from commiting horrible crimes. I don't believe that many people even think about that when they do violent crimes. They are not very clear headed.": 1,
          "The study tried to show that whether a state had capital punishment or not it didn't effect the murder rate. It seemed pretty even throughout the board. It is highly unlikely that it would have an effect on the murder rate. I believe this to be true because of the fact that when someone commits a murder they think they will not get caught. If you never get caught you will never have to face the death penalty. The death penalty is in place for people who we cannot release out into civilization ever again, and do not want to pay for. Why feed a child killer? Just give them the death penalty and save your money.": 1,

There was no significant difference between the numbers and even when the states with capital punishment had lower rates, they were generally not much lower than the other state.

I noticed; however, that there were a few states in which it did not change at all and instead, increased.  However, it most cases, it appears that there was a decrease.  I, personally, am in favor of the death penalty following trial and conviction.  Anything that deters brutal crimes, etc. should be punishable to the highest regard.": 1,

(In my case, I was thinking of a change in the regional economy, among other things)  I think that 14 states is too small a sample and nothing was said about  the chosen states being representative of all regions and subcultures in the US.  A truly broad sampling would be necessary to substantiate such a broad claim.  Also the reductions in murder rates were tiny--usually only by .1.  Nothing was said about how significant that amount actually is but the increases in the murder rate in the other three states were all substantially greater.  This leads me to further wonder if the reductions were just minor anomalies.": 1,

I think the results of the study have show that capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.

I didn't even know a full 1% difference in the graphs when comparing them to the state that did not.  I would then guess that whether or not a state does/doesn't have capital punishment has little to no bearing on murder.  That makes sense as I'm assuming when someone is committing a murder, they are not stopping to think, hey what state am I in and how could this really affect me.  My understanding is that most murders are relatively quick as in it's not normally planned out where someone is weighing the pros and cons.": 1,

That being said, I would like to see a straight demographic sorted by murder rates and then again by whether or not capital punishment is used.

Furthermore, we are not shown the murder rate for states without the death penalty for comparison. Perhaps the rate increased at an even higher rate in those states.

The actions, legal system, and behaviors in one state may vastly differ from those in a \\\\\"comparable\\\"\\\" state.  To me, it goes against reason to say that making severe punishments go away makes severe crime go away.  To that point, I would like to know what the other characteristics of the states compared were before I found any validity in thes findings.

However, when viewing the exact stats, the numbers were very close and I can't remember whether or not they were statistically significant.  Regardless they did not support the premise.   /  / Also trying capital punishment cases is so much more expensive than life imprisonment that even with close stats, capital punishment does not make sense.": 1,

If it was a deterrent to murder, one would expect to see lower murder rates in states with active capital punishment. Since the data showed that the murder rates were actually higher in the states with active capital punishment, the argument that capital punishments deters murder falls apart.": 1,

          "I'm having a hard time seperating reactions here from prior knowledge to be honest. The study by itself seems shallow, both in scope, factors and sample size, in general i don't find it a persuasive argument at all, so while on the surface it's an argument against, i'd actually weight it towards the opposite side- simply because vad science is offensive.": 1,

The reason being is because the murder rate in the boarding states with or without capital punishment does not seem statistically significant.

          "It compared very similar cities (with similar populations and urbanization) in different states and looked for a correlation--if any--between that state's death penalty law and the murder rate. It was clear that in cities located in states supporting the death penalty, the murder rate was significantly lower than in city's located in states without the death penalty. As a scientist, I'm inclined to observe the correlation and conclude that having the dealth penalty makes criminals less likely to commit murder.": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the study provided good enough evidence to support my prior beliefs. However, from the given information on the study, I would not be able to state that the study provided overwhelming support as to capital punishment being a deterrent to murder. ": 1,

I need more data to make an informed decision, murder rates year by year and state by state, including data on other crime rates and general poverty levels.  ": 1,
          "Since the study showed no significant changes between the murder rates of states before and after the institution of capital punishment, critics against capital punishment can use the study to say that there should be no reason to have capital punishment at all, since it effectively does nothing and is unnecessarily cruel.": 1,

I do see how they can definitively say that the death penalty is not a deterrent based on the murder rates of 14 states after a year.

If capital punishment were, in fact, a deterrent to murder, than the murder rates in the state that exercise capital punishment would certainly be lower than in the states that do not, and this was clearly not the case according to the study.": 1,

In some states who impose the death penalty, the murder rate is lower than in a neighboring state that doesn't impose the death penalty, but in others, it's higher. It doesn't seem to matter either way. Thus, should we continue to enforce such a violent and vengeful penalty when it doesn't seem to actually deter the crime it's supposed to deter?

Researchers who did studies to stand against capital punishment were quoted more often in the survey than others. Although there was an opposing view, there was a response to that opposing view from the original researchers who were against capital punishment, as well as their other comments. There was also only visual aids that showed the lack of impact with capital punishment and nothing visual for the other side of the argument.": 1,

Far less than its opposition, in my opinion. ": 1,

THis matches my intuition.": 1,
          "That stats seem to show that murder rate actually increases in states with a death penalty in some cases.": 1,

          "The evidence showed that murder rates were as likely to increase as to decrease following a state instituting the death penalty.  The assumption has to be that capital punishment has no effect unless some effect can be proven.  Thus I think the study supports the proposition that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I feel this study supported capitol punishment because even the critiques of the finding that redid the study came up with the same results, that states with the death penalty lowered the crime rates.": 1,
          "i dont believe that capital punishment can be a deterrent for murder teh prison system in itself dows nothin but create better criminals. peoepl have always killed one anothe rand will always kill one another. punishment should only be focused on teaching the offender they were wrong like hitting a dog with a newspaper but if you use the death penalty no one learned anything because the offender is dead": 1,

It seems that the death penalty does not act as a deterrent for future murders, but a new study that takes into account different factors - number of people admitted (not percentages), new parole laws, other laws enacted that effect the prison community, etc. - is very much needed in order to draw any definite conclusions. ": 1,
          "I think the inconclusiveness and seeming randomness of results both up and down shows that there is very little relationship between capital punishment and deterrence on crime. I don't necessarily think this makes an argument against capital punishment, i just think it says, don't make your argument based on the assumption that it has a deterrence effect because that assumption is baseless.": 1,

Was counseling available, work programs more available, etc in some states and not in others?  I guess what I am trying to say is was there better programs to help criminals get their lives on a better path before they became murderers in the states that had less murders?

The study provided various data from different sources to show me that murder was often significantly lower in states that have believe in capital punishment. i can also see how the end result would deter criminals from committing such crimes. The paragraph I read stated that they even included neighboring states where they have similar urban populations and states that used their death penalty statuses. The data effectively proved that it was definitely a decrease in murder where states have capital punishment laws. ": 1,

In 4 of 10 states with the death penalty murder rates were lower, however, 4 other states had higher murder rates and 2 weren't statistically different.

Seeing the actual numbers, and how small the change was in most of the states in which the rate lowered, supported my view that capital punishment laws likely had not been the cause of the lowered murder rate. The apparent ignorance of the study's authors about the downward trend of crime rates in general, and their lack of explaination for why the change was so small in most of the states in which it lowered, or why rates increased in several states, makes it seem like the study isn't very credible. It seems like the authors were just looking for evidence to support their theory, rather than taking an unbiased look at what the data might actually mean.

Further, if the states bordered one another - it's possible that one might go over state lines to commit the murder.....but I'm not sure that if ALL states had capital punishment if we would see a decrease in murder rates.  I'd also be interested in the effect of capital punishment on other violent crime (rape, assault, etc.).

          "A quote from the article stuck out to me.  It said something along the lines that if capital punishment was a deterrent then the murder rates would be much lower in states that had the death penalty.  And when looking at the graphs you can see that it is not the case.  The numbers are virtually even in states that have the death penalty and states that do not.  ": 1,
          "According to the research, the murder rate should have been higher before the year of adoption, but it wasn't. Due to this information, I feel the research was trying to point out that capital punishment is not an effective deterrent to murder. However, I don't feel that this research was inclusive enough to sway me any particular way.": 1,
          "After I read this article, I still favor capital punishment. But I think someone against capital punishment might use this study result as an evidence for against it.": 1,
          "All the results seemed inconclusive. It lowered it in some areas but raised it in just as many others. I guess maybe because there wasn't enough of a change in either direction it could be said that it doesn't really help at all.": 1,
          "Although I believe in the death penalty, the findings do seem to be inconclusive. Setting feelings aside and just looking at the results you can't really say whether it's a deterrent or not.": 1,
          "As stated in the beginning, the statistically results were uncertain based on a 5 higher, 5 lower and 4 unchanging determination.  Therefore, that particular evidence can not state either yes or now.  Also, as the study continues, the researches needed to edit to allow for disclaimers or possible influential factors that may have impacted the outcomes.  I do not place a high level of trust in the validity of this study although it was quite interesting to read about.": 1,
          "As the results basically showed no net change in murder rates, there is no net benefit to capital punishment.": 1,
          "As the study said, it was inconclusive; there were no major trends in the escalation or deceleration of murder rates when taking the study as a whole into account.": 1,
          "As the study showed a balance of increase and decrease in the number of murders, with other states unchanged.  This gave the indication that the death penalty made no change as to how many murders occurred.  As we are now doing something that isn't a deterrent, the study would lead me to believe that the death penalty isn't effective, and therefore I should be opposed to it.": 1,
          "At first I thought it was convincing for capital punishment, but then when I saw the figures I wasn't nearly as convinced. Yes it dropped some, but not a lot and considering that they didn't factor in other important things, makes it a less credible study.": 1,

          "At first, even if one state saw lower capital punishment crimes then I thought it must be an effective deterrent.  However, I think that a longer time period and more variables may need to be considered to actually conclusively determine the effects of the death penalty as a deterrent.": 1,
          "At first, I didn't think the study tried to persuade anyone either way... the graphics shown spoke for themselves, and the facts were presented in a scientific manner. However, the last page of text mentioned \\\\critics of the study\\\\ arguing for capital punishment, which led me to believe the study was against the subject. So even though it came across as unbiased at first, I would guess the researchers were against capital punishment. ": 1,

          "Because if it was a deterrent it would be more obvious. The compared states it seemed just had different crime rates, perhaps for other reasons. Maybe year to year those states change. But, if it really was a deterrent it seems that would be slightly more obvious. Although I cannot say the study does much for me either way. Maybe a study over a longer period of time?": 1,

          "Because the data suggests a correlation between capital punishment and higher murder rates.  Logic dictates that murder committed by the government - aka capital punishment - may help offenders rationalize their murders.  Perhaps government should be an example, not a participant.  ": 1,
          "Because the evidence in the study did not show that there was an overall difference between murder rates in areas that had capital punishment compared with those that did not.": 1,
          "Because the murder rates in most of the states with capital punishment were lower than the states without capital punishment. ": 1,
          "because the results they showed were states without the death penalty had lower murder rates ": 1,
          "because the study clearly shows that it definately does not deter murder, it actually looks like it makes murder more prevelant in alot of areas.": 1,
          "Because there are other factors that affect crime and the death penalty is not very strict that it will take many years before a prisoner will be sentenced to death.": 1,
          "Because there were more murders in states with the death penalty than without": 1,
          "Because there were other factors involved that could have accounted for the change in murder rates, for instance states vamped up their parole policies for dangerous criminals thus ensuring less were released back into society.": 1,

          "besides a couple of the states researched, almost every state had lower murder rates after adopting capitol punishment. this leads the conclusion that the findings support that capitol punishment is effective at stopping crime.": 1,
          "Beyond the conclusion of the authors was stated as such - the way the information was framed (11 of 14 states murder rate dropped after adoption of the death penalty) leads someone who doesn't look into the data more to believe the death penalty was directly responsible for the drop in murder rate. ": 1,
          "Both sides have the same evidence.": 1,
          "Both sides of the argument were explained: how capital punishment might decrease murder rate and how violence to deter murder might actually increase murder rate.": 1,
          "Both studies show statistical significance that capital punishment does not deter murder per 100,000, in two different data sets with a similar result (8 per ten, and 7 per ten).": 1,
          "By and large, the murder rates in states went down after they approved capital punishment. Even if the crime rates were lower and murder was a higher percentage of all crime, the goal for states should be to lower the total number of murders, not the percentage. Arguably, the crime rates as a whole dropped because of the capital punishment laws, leading to the higher percentage of murders. The study can expand its data set as more years pass, but in the short term, capital punishment seems to deter murders. It should be noted that I am biased, as I am for capital punishment, so I probably would skew this data to my favor.": 1,
          "By pushing the more violent crime in states that adopt the death penalty. I think overall there's not enough support either way but the research was only done over 1 year and not multiple.": 1,
          "Capital punishment is good for a deterrent to murder.  If you murder someone you should be able to receive capital punishment.  The death penalty is a fair sentence for someone who murdered a person.": 1,
          "Crime was lower in the majority of states with capital punishment in comparison to border states without capital punishment.": 1,
          "Data can be manipulated in statistics to suit a premise. IMO the data comparing the murder rates before and after the introduction of capital punishment are more relevant than the data using murder rates as a fraction of the total crime.": 1,

          "DID CHANGE MY OPINION. SEEMS MURDER RATE WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN THE NEXT YEAR IF THERE WAS OR WASNT A DEATH PENALTY. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WOULD BE A GREAT DETERRENT FOR JAY-WALKING BUT NOT FOR MURDER WHICH IS USUALLY A CRIME OF PASSION.": 1,
          "DID NOT DETERR SINCE RATES WENT UP ANY WAY": 1,
          "Did support that capital punishment is a deterrent since the results were almost reproduced as the first case": 1,
          "Even though the evidence is open to criticism and may be refuted with future studies, such as ones correcting for overall drops in crime rates, the fact is that the evidence given does suggest that the institution of capital punishment lowers the rate of crime. Until this most direct observation is contradicted by better data, it is fair to conclude that capital punishment probably does have a deterring effect. ": 1,
          "Far too few independent variables were included in the study for it to be convincing.  As the critics mentioned of the study already mentioned there were too many other factors which were not considered.": 1,
          "First, the number of states with capital punishment with a lower murder rate was equal to those with a higher murder rate. There was no significant difference between the numbers and even when the states with capital punishment had lower rates, they were generally not much lower than the other state. If it really had a deterrent effect on crime, I would think the difference would be much starker. The fact their second study showed the same results drives this point home.": 1,
          "I actually don't think that capital punishment works as a deterrent to murder.  I wish that it did and I really do not like to see capital punishment done however it would we can only hope that there would be something to halt the many murders that we see each day.": 1,
          "I agree that other mitigating factors could have influenced the study, as the critics claim; however, there has been no data that I'm aware of that show capital punishment is a deterrent to murder or other violent capital crimes.  This study shows that murder rates went up after reinstatement of the death penalty; I believe those statistics regardless of other factors.  ": 1,
          "I agree that the selections of the pairs of states may cause a problem with the study. If that is not taken into account it shows that capital punishment is not effective at doing the only thing it's good for.": 1,
          "I am for capital punishment even before reading about the study. I think it concludes that it can be a deterrent. Showing a decrease in that many states is not an aberration.": 1,
          "I believe it did because for the most part murder rates went down": 1,
          "I believe it showed support that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder. It was done twice, and in both cases-- the majority of the 10 neighboring states had a higher murder rate in states that had capital punishment. The graphs helped me to understand this to be true.": 1,
          "I believe it supports capital punishment because it's letting you know how a lot of the states are not enforcing it when they should.": 1,
          "I believe it supports that capital punishment is somewhat of a deterrent.  But this could very over time, as demographics and economics shift.  I still believe that taking a life is wrong.  ": 1,
          "I believe it supports the argument but only slightly. It does show that it helps but just slightly so.": 1,
          "I believe it would be a good argument against capital punishment because the study shows that there was no main difference in the states with vs without capital punishment.": 1,
          "I believe numbers can pretty much tell any story you want them to tell. I think that many people who are uninformed before being presented with this study would find the evidence compelling that the death penalty deters people from committing murder. This study would need several more data points/years before and after the laws for the death penalty began to take place. I personally don't believe a murderer is going to be detered by consequencesof their actions. A person who wants to take or does I feel thinks little about the consequences. This is a bogus study and we need more data points to make any sort of intelligent hypothesis.": 1,
          "I BELIEVE THAT BY JUST CHECKING THE NEXT YEAR STATISTICS IS NOT ENOUGH TO PROVE THE THEORY THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DID NOT WORK.  THE BODY OF WORK OR THE TIME PERIOD NEEDS TO BE LONGER AND MORE ASPECTS NEED TO BE LOOKED AT.  MAYBE MORE SPECIFICS ON EACH CASE IF POSSIBLE ALONG WITH THE PAROLE NUMBERS THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER.": 1,
          "I believe that it did not support the argument because it only shows 2 years worth of data.  More data would need to be considered in order to conclusively say that the legislation worked.": 1,
          "I believe that it was unbiased, as everything was presented in an unbiased matter.": 1,
          "I believe that the factors represented were first ,not sampled long enough ant that more long term follow-up tracking is needed for a more definitive direction.This study was based only on the before and after years represented.Such a result could be merely coincidental. ": 1,
          "I believe that the first study showing that murder rates are higher on average where there is no capital punishment is convincing enough....however I have a difficult time looking at this in a unbiased manner because I support the death penalty if the killer is guilty without a doubt. I do think that both studies were a bit flawed though because you would have to look at all states per capita average as a whole on both sides of the spectrum, you can't just compare neighboring states because other factors come into play such as economic conditions etc.": 1,
          "I believe that the study did not support the arguement that captial punishment is a deterrent to murder based on their choice to link higher murder rates with capital punishment laws without exploring other factors that could skew the results.": 1,
          "I believe that the study did very well in supporting the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  The articles do well in explaining how crime has gone down.  Not enough to sway me, but I do believe that they did a good job here.": 1,
          "I believe the researchers did the relevant research, but due to the fact that an equal number of states both rose and fell in murder rates and left the rest of the 14 states neutral, anyone could naturally conclude that evidence for capital punishment being a deterrent is inconclusive.  ": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support  the argument that capital punishment is a deterent to murder because the findings showed that murder rates were actually higher in those states who used capital punishment. ": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument for capital punishment because it showed that murder rates went up after capital punishment was introduced in 11 out of 14 states.": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the study provided good enough evidence to support my prior beliefs. However, from the given information on the study, I would not be able to state that the study provided overwhelming support as to capital punishment being a deterrent to murder. ": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. If the both the study and its follow up are split between both results, then I see that as a failure of capital punishment to enact meaningful change. Not to mention, the costs associated with the death penalty are proven to be higher per prisoner.": 1,
          "I believe the study did support the argument that capital is a deterrent to murder, however I believe the study is inaccurate as their would be other factors that may contribute to reduction of murder such as the availablity of social programs in that particular state. ": 1,
          "I believe the study showed that capital punishment was not a deterrent. It showed that just because a state has the death penelty it may still have as many or more murders.": 1,
          "I believe the study supported capital punishment, as the evidence presented in the study had numbers that stated capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. There wasn't much opposing evidence.": 1,
          "I believe the study wanted to know if people would agree with the information given to them, and if so, whether or not their new idea could be changed by influence of new information coming to light.": 1,
          "I believe the study was somewhat supported that capital punishment does not deter murder.   After capital punishment was reinstated, some states had less murder and some states had more murder.  The results were mixed.  I believe mixed results show that capital punishment does not deter crime.": 1,
          "I believe the the study did not support the fact that capital punishment deters murder because it showed that murder rates were higher in 11 of 14 states after they adopted the death penalty. ": 1,
          "I believe the way that the study was skewed the data was presented in a way that simply said if the murder rate went up or down without including the general crime rate as well. I feel like they were doing it on purpose because they simply wanted the data to show that capital punishment worked out well in almost all of the states. Except it's not the case when it's put against the full crime rate, it shows that rates of all crimes went down, was that because of capital punishment or not? Without all of the data with crime rates it makes it a bit more bias toward pro capital punishment.": 1,
          "I believe they support it because they said that many states the murder rate was lower but did not include other factors as well. ": 1,

          "I believed capital punishment was a good way to control murders and crimes, but this study makes me seriously think that I have been wrong this whole time. There are still some places where the crimes are higher even with capital punishment, so obviously this method is not working. ": 1,
          "I believed it was neither. Statistics were used to draw a conclusion from. The statistic indicated a decrease in murder rate after capital punishment was implemented. This could be coincidental or a correlation.": 1,

          "I do believe it was being used (the study) to show capital punishment was not working. The effect was more supported within the study with the graphs and listing of deaths. The study in my opinion looked to be done well.": 1,
          "I don't believe that such a minor percent change had anything to do with the death penalty. In my eyes, crime rates stayed roughly the same over the years. They slighty changed due to the natural flow of crime.": 1,

          "i don't see why this is bad i think every country should considerate the death penalty.It's only bad for the criminals": 1,
          "I don't think enough time was studied to show the true affect and if it would deter crime more or not. A year's difference isn't much. The study didn't go into a whole lot of detail either. The article also ended as inconclusive, so it doesn't prove one way or another.": 1,

          "I don't think it did either. If 5 states had a positive change and 5 states had a negative change while 4 states had no change at all, it seems to balance itself out. It would not change anyone's mind about capital punishment. Everyone can pick and choose what they want to highlight their argument.": 1,

          "I don't think it supported that capital punishment deters murder because in most of the states, the was generally no relation between the murder rate and whether the state had capital punishment or not.": 1,
          "I don't think it supports that argument, but I think it's suggestive of something. They would need to control for all of those other factors before I would feel confident using it as evidence.": 1,
          "I don't think its a big deterrent, but I also don't think that it is the cause of more murders by making people think that since the government does it, they get the idea to do it. I think it would deter some which is better than none. ": 1,
          "I don't think that capital punishment is going to change the rate of murder overall for anywhere to be honest.  The system is still broken and the length of time between commiting and death is far to long for a study that goes back and forward a year.  I mean most people convicted in 2012 probably won't be put to death for 5 or more years.  If that system was made more efficient it might put a little more thought into people's minds but even then it won't change much.  ": 1,
          "i don't think that it supports because they should've used similar size cities.": 1,
          "I don't think that the biggest issue in capital punishment is really deterring crime.  I think it's more along the lines of justice as well as jail over crowding.  I see for and against arguments.  I don't ever like the idea of executing someone who is innocent but at the same time they will also rot in jail for a long time too so.  If someone is definitely guilty and there's no chance of rehabilitation (and even so I think some crimes should never be pardoned) then I really don't have a problem with capitol punishment.  But like I said it's not a deterrent and the mixed results are not really that mixed since the rate of crime is marginally different.": 1,
          "I don't think that the study provides ample evidence either for or against the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. The main problem I have with it is also the fact that it primarily accounts for the years immediately before and after the adoption of the capital punishment laws. Without looking at a longer period of time (maybe 5 years before and after instead of 1) I don't think any significant conclusions can be drawn. I'm also inclined to agree with the critics of the study that there are also many factors that may have changed in addition to adoption of the capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "I don't think that the study was very conclusive - at first I thought it was, but after you showed the argument that there were a lot of other contributing factors not taken into account (parole laws, etc.) I reevaluated my decision. It seems that the death penalty does not act as a deterrent for future murders, but a new study that takes into account different factors - number of people admitted (not percentages), new parole laws, other laws enacted that effect the prison community, etc. - is very much needed in order to draw any definite conclusions.

          "I don't think the study supported either way.  I think the researchers were just trying to see if capital punishment had any bearings on whether or not people would commit murders in their state.  It seems to me that they didn't care if they were convicted of murdering someone and received the death sentence.  If someone is going to murder, it doesn't matter to them (I guess) if they are put to death.": 1,
          "i dont believe that capital punishment can be a deterrent for murder teh prison system in itself dows nothin but create better criminals. peoepl have always killed one anothe rand will always kill one another. punishment should only be focused on teaching the offender they were wrong like hitting a dog with a newspaper but if you use the death penalty no one learned anything because the offender is dead": 1,

          "I feel like I might flip flop between support and non-support of capital punishment because there are studies like these that seem to make it true that it helps deter murder, but seeing the actual numbers and how small the divide is makes me a little less eager to believe it's true that it does deter murder. I think I'll hold out and support the least violent choice until something more convincing comes along.": 1,
          "I feel like it didn't really make the case for either; all the positive statistics are countered by negative ones and the negative ones are balanced out by positive ones and the remainder are null values essentially.": 1,
          "I feel like most of the proponents of capital punishment want justice. They don't care about it being a deterrent to crime. Most of the proponents think that murders will be murders with or without capital punishment. They just want to see these murderers \\\\pay\\\\ for their crimes. ": 1,
          "I feel that it did not support it by proving that murder rates are for the most part lower in states with no capital punishment. However, I'm not convinced that they controlled for all differences that might lead to higher murder rates in the first place. Perhaps some of those states would have even higher rates if they didn't have the death penalty.": 1,

          "I feel that the sample size was too small to make such an important judgement on something that affects a nation. Perhaps if every state was taken account for and the results were maintained, the study could be fairly convincing. The fact that it was replicated on 10 other states definitely helps strengthen the argument but in my eyes is not enough to 100% convince me one way or another.": 1,
          "I feel that the study showed a good amount of data, and it was clear in proving that the capital punishment does not stop crime as many people would believe, so this stance cannot be used as an argument for the capital punishment.  Even when they re-did the study, the numbers showed the same, there's no data that proves capital punishment stops crime": 1,
          "I feel this study supported capitol punishment because even the critiques of the finding that redid the study came up with the same results, that states with the death penalty lowered the crime rates.": 1,

          "I felt that the numbers presented showed that murder rates stayed around the same and even rose in some cases. This would say to me that the death penalty is not in fact deterring murders.": 1,
          "I felt that the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  There are many other factors that could have contributed to the reduction of the murder rates in the 11 states after the death penalty was adopted.  These factors were not all included in the study, therefore it is not logical to say that there is a correlation between the death penalty being put in place and murder rates decreasing.  ": 1,

I don't know what the right thing to do is, and I'm glad its not up to me to decide. As far as this study goes, I just find it doubtful that this could be true, or even if it is, that removing the death penalty doesn't sound like it would accomplish anything.": 1,

If the only thing that changed was capital punishment or not, then the study seemed like it could be plausible and may show an actual result. But since it included extra things like different parol procedures, those may skew the results thus invalidating them, in other words Murders may have gone down but it may or may not have been to capital punishment and if it was not then it makes the results worthless.": 1,
          "I think it does not support the argument because when expressed as a percentage of total crime the murder rate did not go down. Which means that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder, but rather the crime rate is simply going down. ": 1,
          "I think it does support that capital punishment deterrs murder because in 8 out of 10 states, murder rates were lower then states without it. It shows if citizens see there is capitol punishment laws in affect, they are less likely to murder someone. ": 1,

          "I think it proves that capital punishment has very little, if any, deterrent effect on murders committed. If it did, murder rates would be consistently lower in states that had it, instead of the opposite. I also think it likely that states that have the death penalty would tend to have governments that foster the kind of culture that leads to murders, such as lax gun laws, and general hostility towards less affluent groups,(I.e. less welfare and job training and other support systems for the poor), which then leads to desperation, and a general downward trend in security, and therefore, more crime, which could explain why murders are more prevalent in states where the death penalty is popular.": 1,

          "I think it supports capital punishment since the findings targeted certain pairs of states and not every pair of states in the US which might lead us to find that capital punishment doesn't deter murder. But also murder should not be the only crime we look at, they should look at other violent offences as well": 1,
          "I think it supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because in the majority of states the murder rate went down after capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "I think it was more in the middle, there were a lot of good evidence and I did notice some of a decrease after the death penalty was in place. I honestly believe if someone is going to commit a crime they probably won't think about the penalty that will follow.": 1,
          "I think obviously the point of the study was to suggest that murder rates are higher in states where there is capital punishment, at least on average.  Hence, it seems clear that capital punishment does not serve as a deterrent.": 1,
          "I think one year is not an appropriate time limit to study - you need to study the affects the death penalty or lack there of has as it sinks in through society.  Growing up knowing about the death penalty might have more of an affect on crimes you commit as an adult than just the law changing without you knowing about it one year.  Besides that, the states were split evenly on having an increase, decrease, or stable murder rate so I'm not sure you can draw any conclusion just from those numbers - plus I wasn't sure if the rate of increase was equal or more or less than the rate of decrease in the various states.  That should probably have been looked at as well.": 1,
          "I think that capital punishment definitely is a deterrent to murder because it shows criminals that if they commit a murder, then they are sure to get the death penalty. This deters a good amount of would-be-murderers away from carrying out their crime, because they know they will be caught and they also know that they will definitely be sentenced to death. ": 1,
          "I think that is shows the rates are about the same and does not seem to have any correlation to the death penalty. ": 1,
          "I think that it could be used to deter using capitol punishment because research has shown it is isn't helping combat the murder rate.": 1,
          "I think that it did not because it was mostly inconclusive. If it was to support capital punishment, you would expect to see the murder rate go down to validate that punishment. Though, it would be interesting to see a study over a period longer than one year, a lot of people may not know about it after just one year.": 1,
          "I think that it supports the argument that capital punishment is NOT a deterrent to murder.  The reason being is because the murder rate in the boarding states with or without capital punishment does not seem statistically significant.  Obviously, I can't be 100% sure by simply eyeballing the data, but there is no obvious slam dunk in the data which suggests that capital punishment is actually a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I think that it was just people doing experiments to prove each other wrong in the end. basic competition.": 1,
          "I think that it was neither supported nor did not support it because the findings were for the most, equal.": 1,
          "I think that making the use of the death penalty or not as the major indicator of murder is a weak arguement.  Just beacuse the states that were compared had similar profiles doesn't mean they were a great comparison group.  The actions, legal system, and behaviors in one state may vastly differ from those in a \\\\comparable\\\\ state.  To me, it goes against reason to say that making severe punishments go away makes severe crime go away.  To that point, I would like to know what the other characteristics of the states compared were before I found any validity in thes findings.  A better comparison would be to use the same state using the death penalty during a number of years and than not using it (assuming not much time had past).": 1,
          "I think that the data did not show a wide enough variance to account for a substantial decrease that would indicate that instituting the death penalty actually led to a decrease in murders that could not be explained away by simple fluctuations from year to year.  It would have been nice to see an average over the years, or maybe see data for five to ten years prior to make a more sound judgement.  The detractors brought up a good point and it was countered with a weak point that did not have any data to support it.": 1,
          "I think that the researchers did a too job of controlling for other factors that might skew the study. Since I am already opposed to the death penalty, the findings did not change my opinion. One month but argue also that the prospect if life without parole might be more of a deterrent than the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think that the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. I admit I may be somewhat biased here, because I am staunchly against the death penalty, but if the statistics sited were accurate, there is no way they could support the argument that capital punishment deters murder.  /  / If the murder rate indeed went up in the majority of states that enacted or reinstated capital punishment, then that tells me it isn't a deterrent. If it had been a deterrent, I would think the murder rate would have plummeted, or at least dropped noticeably.  /  /  ": 1,
          "I think that the study results are a bit ambiguous -- I don't think they clearly show that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder because of the other factors involved (other laws changing within the states, etc), and some of the states even had the murder rate go up.": 1,
          "I think that the study was clearly positioned in favor of capital punishment. They only presented data that showed their point of view favorablly. When you exam the data closer you can definitely see that there were a lot more factors contributing to the lower murder rate than just capitol punishment.": 1,

          "I think that the study was done poorly and did not consider very many of the factors involved. It gives no clear evidence either way whatsoever.": 1,
          "I think that the study was supportive of capital punishment. The study provided various data from different sources to show me that murder was often significantly lower in states that have believe in capital punishment. i can also see how the end result would deter criminals from committing such crimes. The paragraph I read stated that they even included neighboring states where they have similar urban populations and states that used their death penalty statuses. The data effectively proved that it was definitely a decrease in murder where states have capital punishment laws. ": 1,
          "I think that the study was to see if one would change their perception of capitol punishment based on studies. I think the study clearly showed that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder. And considering the fact they redid the survey three years later using different states and they got essentialy the same results backs their original premise that it does not deter criminal behavior.": 1,
          "I think that the study wasn't necessarily for or against capital punishment, but I think that it seems that most places that had capital punishment continued to have problems with crime and murder.": 1,
          "I think that they were very selective in choosing the bordering state comparisons instead of the murder rates as a whole for both": 1,
          "I think that this study was designed to try and show that their is no real positive effect of the death penalty on crime rates.  It showed that in most states that the crime rate on murders had actually increased after the adoption of the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think that was a very good study with their rates and opinion and that study makes me see that the capital punishment is the best way to stop murders.": 1,
          "I think that with the type of data which was shown, it would be very easy to accuse the data of being \\\\cherry-picked\\\\, as it appears to only cover one time period. Perhaps a more statistically rigorous, long term, statistics supported study would be more convincing. Nonetheless, at first glance it would appear that at the very least, capital punishment is NOT an effective deterrent, though whether there is an associated RISE in murder rates has not been determined.": 1,
          "I think that, while the researchers appeared to use good methods, it seems that the results may hold some bias in favor of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. Since the study was replicated using another 10 states, it could be said that 15/?? states have lower rates out of 20 (if i recall correctly). however, after doing some basic research, it could appear that upwards of 32 states have capital punishment. Therefore, it cannot be said that these studies are certainly proving a fact; rather they are testing a theory. Therefore it makes sense that these studies are supporting the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. I think the researchers shouldnt limit themselves to just 10 states, or using 10 \\\\different\\\\ states in relation to this. It should really be all 32 states. ": 1,
          "I think the article supported the idea that capital punishment is a detterent in the fact that it illustrated that states that enforce capital punishment have a lower crime rate in comparison to those states that do not.  Since the study was replicated using different states, and the results ended u very similar, it is a good indicator that capital punishment may be a good deterrent.": 1,
          "I think the biggest emphasis was put on states in which capital punishment is a punishment and the highlight of the study is that states with capital punishment actually have a higher murder rate than neighboring states where there is no capital punishment. The study seems to not only be a study but an argument based on fact and it seems logical that if an argument was being made, the argument would be that capital punishment does not actually deter the crime of murder and some might argue, that capital punishment actually creates a violent mindset.": 1,
          "I think the critiques mentioned in the past page brought up good points. There could have been good reasons that were unrelated to the adoption of the death penalty that caused the murder rate to drop. Also, 1/4th of states actually had HIGHER murder rates after the adoption of capital punishment.": 1,
          "I think the inconclusiveness and seeming randomness of results both up and down shows that there is very little relationship between capital punishment and deterrence on crime. I don't necessarily think this makes an argument against capital punishment, i just think it says, don't make your argument based on the assumption that it has a deterrence effect because that assumption is baseless.": 1,
          "I think the numbers show that it's pretty clear that capital punishment doesn't deter crime in a substantial way. The first study and the second study coming up with just about the same conclusions (murder rates in states that have capital punishment vs states who do not) is, at least to me, pretty solid evidence.": 1,
          "I think the numbers speak for themselves. The studies seems legitimate, and seem to support capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I think the problem is that the states don't advertise the fact that they have the death penalty. If they said \\\\You Kill Someone, We Kill You\\\\, I think it'd be a deterrant. But most of the idiots doing the killing, don't know that shit.": 1,
          "I think the research supported capital punishment as a deterent. I think that the survey was sort of misleading. I think there might have been other factors that caused the research to lean toward capital punhisment  as deterent. I don't think capital punishment is a deterent.": 1,

I think you need more years to study such case not just a few years. This is such a serious / matter that a lot more factor should be consider. I think  establish company like The Learning Channel  or Discovery Channel / or other similar company like that should spearhead the study. The company have the resource for it and time.": 1,

          "I think the study addresses the main reason that people who support capital punishment use in their arguments - capital punishment deters violent crimes, due to the fear factor. The results of the study do not support this argument, because the data shows no clear causality between capital punishment and reduced violent crime rates. The findings of the study would be welcomed by those opposing capital punishment, because they now have scientific evidence on their side that it is a deterrent.  ": 1,
          "I think the study attempted to be fair; hioweverf, I think there were a lot of unanswered questions, such as the demographics of the states studies - income, education, etc., of the citizenry. /  / If anything, the study, taken as is, reinforces my opinion that the death penalty is NOT a deterrent.  I still oppose the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think the study did barely support that the death penalty does not deter murder only if you look purely at the data and don't pay attention to any other changes or how small the changes in murder rate were. It did show an increase in the murder rate, which at face value looks like it was not a deterrent.": 1,
          "I think the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because in every pair of states that they used, the murder rates were very similar.  I think that this study shows that states that are geographically close to each other and have similar characteristics (similar percentage of urban population) will have similar murder rates.  I think the results of the study have show that capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.  The differences in murder rates, where they existed, were very small and went in both directions.": 1,
          "I think the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. I also think that there are areas of the country that are much more violent than others. I think that crime in these areas would happen whether or not there was capital punishment in the state because criminals that commit murder aren't \\\\scared\\\\ of going to jail or dying because of a crime they commited, or maybe they think they won't be caught.

          "I think the study did point out a slight difference in whether or not capital punishment acted as a deterrent to murder. However, not many of the differences in percentages were very significant. In fact, I believe that the two states with the largest difference was skewed towards the state WITH capital punishment. With this in mind, I think that capital punishment isn't a big enough deterrent overall to warrant using such extreme measures as \\\\crime prevention.\\\\": 1,
          "I think the study did support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. It showed that in the same area, that the city that did have capital punishment had a higher murder rate.": 1,
          "I think the study I just read supported capital punishment because it showed how similar states have more homicides if they don't have capital punishment. I think 8 out of 10 states is convincing in favor of capital punishment but I think there still needs to be larger studies.": 1,
          "I think the study is flawed because of the length of the study.  One year of statistics isn't enough to show a pattern.  Some states even had an increase in murder rates.": 1,

          "I think the study showed support to capital punishment because it seemed like that was initially what they wanted to set out and prove -- that capital punishment works as a deterrent.  When people came to them saying that it wasn't a thoroughly done test, then the researchers came out and did the test again to prove those people wrong and that they stood behind their results.   ": 1,
          "I think the study showed that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder because the numbers were not correlated.  If capital punishment has no effect, then why have it at all?": 1,
          "I think the study shows that capital punishment is not a deterrent. Murder rates appeared to increase following adoption of the death penalty in most states. Even though critics blamed other reasons for the results, such as difficult parole rules, the study organizers mentioned that a similar number of states had more lenient rules to even things out, and the numbers still stood as higher in most cases.": 1,
          "I think the study was bad.  One year's worth on data does not establish any sort of trend or long term effect,  that year could be the exception.  Even if the data wasn't picked to support a pre-established premise,  it's still seems a poor methodology.": 1,
          "I think the study was inconclusive as to the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. The results could be twisted by proponents of either side.": 1,
          "I think the study was inconclusive as to whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  Their sampling of states was small, although the selection of states meeting the criteria is understandably limited, and the results obtained were basically a wash. And within those results the difference in murder rates isn't that large one way or another and could be interpreted as having little, if any, impact on the effectiveness of capital punishment to deter crimes.": 1,
          "I think there could be other factors, but I am willing to believe it is a deterrant. The statistics bear it out, except for a few exceptions.    / However, since so many people have been electrocuted who later turned out to be innocent and many are wrongly jailed, I have a hard time supporting capital punishment.  There also is a very disproportional amount of Black people in jails, and we just need to do more to address the problems of  Blacks and address racial perceptions.   / I also wish in most instances there could be some therapy, because a lot has to do with environment or brain configuration.  I don't think we know enough about what else we can do to prevent crime.  I do know when someone is a serial killer or a bomber, I am 99% fine with the death penalty.  ": 1,

          "I think these figures would be obvious as they are simply a matter of record.  They would be difficult to mask.  It doesn't appear the study proved favorable to either side of this argument.  What other factors came into play.  Were the rehabilitation conditions different, better/worse, per state?  Was counseling available, work programs more available, etc in some states and not in others?  I guess what I am trying to say is was there better programs to help criminals get their lives on a better path before they became murderers in the states that had less murders?  Did the death penalty have an effect at all?": 1,

There were plain facts showing that  in 9 of the 14 states, the murder rate either worsened or stayed the same. Only in 5 states did it actually improve, and i believe that probably had nothing to do with  the capital punishment law. Simply just numbers fluctuating.": 1,
          "I thought it presented great facts that do indeed support capital punishment works to deter murder.

          "I thought that it did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, because the results of the study were to point out statistics that in real life, use of capital punishment, or knowing that it is a possibility, does not have the practical effect of lowering the murder rate.

One could make the case that since there wasn't a significant drop in murders that there isn't a deterrent effect. My own personal belief is if a  murderer is put to death, that murderer certainly will not repeat the crime.": 1,
          "I thought the study did not support the arguement that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. If it did suppor it, we would expect the murder rate to be lower in the states which have used capital punishement, but instead we see the opposite in most cases. ": 1,
          "I thought the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  This is because the study showed that of the 14 states that had passed the capital punishment law, 11 of them saw a rise in the murder right the following year.  This is all the study focused on, rather than looking at the increase/decrease in the murder rate compared to all other crimes.  Had they done this as well then the study would have been much more fair.": 1,
          "I thought the study I just read was supporting capital punishment because they had multiple charts showing that most states' crime rate decreased after adopting capital punishment. They also talked about how the crime rates decreased significantly after adopting it.": 1,
          "I thought the study showed clearly that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder. If it were you would expect to see a lower murder rate in states that have capital punishment, but that is not the case. Capital punishment doesn't seem to have an effect on murder rates one way or another. ": 1,
          "I thought the study supported the arguement that captial punishment is a deterrent to murder because 8 out of 10 pairs had lower murder rates in the state with captial punishment. When they were criticized they were able to get pretty much the same result with different neighboring states.": 1,

          "I thought the study was in favor of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. They seemed to emphasize the findings that supported the idea that capital punishment is effective (the lower murder rates) and didn't call attention to the fact that other factors may have been at play. Also, the decrease in murders over that one year were mostly small decreases and could have been accounted for (some of them at least) in standard deviation.": 1,
          "I thought the study would be more likely to convince someone that capital punishment was not a deterremt because if it was truly effective the pairs without lower rates that had capital punishment would show a mark contrast to those who don't.  The largest disparity  is .3.  If it was such a great punishment the gap should be larger.  If anything this study shows that punishment doesn't matter to someone who wants to commit murder.": 1,

          "I thought this study did nothing to prove that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. The results were inconclusive because In 4 states there was more crime, in 4 states, there was less crime, and in 2 states the murder rates were the same. Since the results were so evenly divided, one cannot conclude if it is a deterrent or not. ": 1,

It would depend on the states involved.  I would expect a difference between CA and OR from CA and NV, if they were even involved.  As it is, it won't sway my opinion in the least.": 1,
          "I'm having a hard time seperating reactions here from prior knowledge to be honest. The study by itself seems shallow, both in scope, factors and sample size, in general i don't find it a persuasive argument at all, so while on the surface it's an argument against, i'd actually weight it towards the opposite side- simply because vad science is offensive.": 1,
          "I'm not fully convinced that this study supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, as the authors of the study have concluded.  Critics claim that though the murder rate fell, the crime rate in all of those states fell as well, and murder makes up a greater percentage of total crime in each of those states.  My biggest complaint is that the study had no true controls.  They did not compare the data they gathered on states that reinstated capital punishment against the rest of the 50 states that did not change their capital punishment laws.  It's conceivable that the murder rate across the country fell, regardless of capital punishment laws.  Second, the study only looked at the murder rate numbers on the year before capital punishment was reinstated and the subsequent year.  To me this seems like a small sample size, and I'd like to see if there were comparable variance in murder rates across other years for each of those states studied.": 1,
          "I'm not sure that the differences are meaningful.  It looks like the murder rate in a lot of the comparisons differed by just a couple of points - I'm not sure that they mean much.  Further, if the states bordered one another - it's possible that one might go over state lines to commit the murder.....but I'm not sure that if ALL states had capital punishment if we would see a decrease in murder rates.  I'd also be interested in the effect of capital punishment on other violent crime (rape, assault, etc.).  It looks like there may be a trend....but it may be beneficial to look at states that change their \\\\capital punishment status\\\\ and see if there is a drop or rise in violent crime.": 1,

          "If the people responsible for the study were to examine different areas, the results could have easily shown that the death penalty was not an effective deterrent. For this reason it seems likely that they chose 10 areas that would support their position of the death penalty being a deterrent.": 1,
          "If the states and the researchers wanted to hold this up as proof, the addition of the death penalty should have happened on its own so that any change in the statistics would definitely be as a result of it. This was not a clean study.": 1,
          "If the states with capital punishment had generally lower murder rates than those without capital punishment, then the study clearly argues that capital punishment works as a deterrent. I think the results would have been much different the second time around if that wasn't the case.": 1,
          "If the study shows that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, then it must also support the view of opponents to the death penalty that capital punishment increases the murder rate by institutionalizing the taking of life. Either both views are correct and off-setting, or neither is. I would believe that it is neither. Either way, if there is no net benefit to society conferred by the death penalty as the study shows, then there is no reason to risk executing innocent people by mistake. I would say that this study does not support capital punishment.": 1,
          "If there is no drop in murder rates that is that noticeable and the outside factors involved want to push the change down (the fact that parole became stricter) then it clearly shows that life in prison is just as much of a deterrent as death row in that you will do everything you can to avoid both.  THis matches my intuition.": 1,
          "if there's no evidence that it deters people from committing crime then we're just killing people for no reason, right? innocent people have been administered the death penalty before, it's not worth keeping around especially if it doesn't do jack": 1,

          "In a few states with capital punishment, the murder rates were higher. However, the differences were small. In states without capital punishment, where the murder rate was higher, the differences were huge. While this might not necessarily correlate to the lack of a death penalty, it's clear that an overall look at the results of the states combined should have perhaps been done as well. ": 1,
          "In all of the states compared the difference between those that do not have capital punishment those that do have capital punishment (and have used it), there is not much difference.  I didn't even know a full 1% difference in the graphs when comparing them to the state that did not.  I would then guess that whether or not a state does/doesn't have capital punishment has little to no bearing on murder.  That makes sense as I'm assuming when someone is committing a murder, they are not stopping to think, hey what state am I in and how could this really affect me.  My understanding is that most murders are relatively quick as in it's not normally planned out where someone is weighing the pros and cons.": 1,
          "In most of the 14 states, murder rates were down.  However, in the few with increased murder rates, the difference in before/after numbers was greater.  In general, I would agree with the study but have to admit I don't think it provided complete confirmation.": 1,
          "In most of the states where capital punishment was just enacted, the crime rate did go down. I'm guessing about half of the states had changes in parole, so the net effect of that remains the same. ": 1,
          "In my opinion, a 1 year difference will not be enough proof to determine if the death penalty actually does/does not deter murder.": 1,

Throw in a percentage here and a ratio there and one can have evidence for any stance they choose. The same goes for using a single metric, such as change over a period of one year. Stretch that out to ten years and the result might be different. The old saying \\\\numbers don't lie\\\\ is only partially true.

While neighboring states is somewhat persuasive there needs to be more info gathered.": 1,

Aside from the corporal punishment laws, I believe it is also important to take into consideration the state of the economy in each state, the environment in which the criminal was raised in, etc. While it is completely possible that capital punishment may or may not be a deterrent to murder, causation does not mean correlation; therefore, it can not be determined based on whether a state allows or disallows capital punishment alone.": 1,

That would be my biggest critique; murder is only one crime of many. As a whole it does show that the death penalty doesn't deter murder, which should be self-evident when you look at the motivations for murder.  It's either a crime a passion and the murderer has no care or concern for the reprecussions, it's done for money and again the death penalty doesn't deter hitmen, or it's done because the person is mentally ill and because this person has no concept of right or wrong or gives in to some weird sick twisted desire they again are not detered by capital punishment.

Also, without examples of people actually being executed (the process takes several years through the courts), advocates can say that the deterent isn't fully effective.

          "My biggest critique is that it didn't mention why only 14 states were selected.  More than 14 states have capital punishment.": 1,
          "My first thought was that, given that the study did not at first say how much the rate dropped in the states in which it did drop, and given that I know that crime rates in general have been going down, it seemed likely that the rates could have just gone down because crime rates are trending downward. Seeing the actual numbers, and how small the change was in most of the states in which the rate lowered, supported my view that capital punishment laws likely had not been the cause of the lowered murder rate. The apparent ignorance of the study's authors about the downward trend of crime rates in general, and their lack of explaination for why the change was so small in most of the states in which it lowered, or why rates increased in several states, makes it seem like the study isn't very credible. It seems like the authors were just looking for evidence to support their theory, rather than taking an unbiased look at what the data might actually mean. The study just does not provide convincing evidence that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. ": 1,
          "My thoughts were much like those of the study's critics--the researchers did not appear to attempt to control for other factors which could effect the murder rate.  (In my case, I was thinking of a change in the regional economy, among other things)  I think that 14 states is too small a sample and nothing was said about  the chosen states being representative of all regions and subcultures in the US.  A truly broad sampling would be necessary to substantiate such a broad claim.  Also the reductions in murder rates were tiny--usually only by .1.  Nothing was said about how significant that amount actually is but the increases in the murder rate in the other three states were all substantially greater.  This leads me to further wonder if the reductions were just minor anomalies.": 1,
          "My view is that if there is no appearant benefit from Capitol punishment as a detterant, it should not be used. The study shows that there is no appearant benefit. And it is believable.": 1,

          "No idea": 1,
          "On principle, I think that capital punishment does not exist to deter future crimes, but rather to provide an appropriate sentence for the worst of crimes already committed.  In addition to that, I would feel very confident that none of the changes presented on the graph were statistically significant.  Even if you were opposing the death penalty due to its possible inability to prevent future murders, you would need to demonstrate a substantial difference in the murder rate trends over a span of time including many years before to many years after the legal changes to draw any conclusions.  In summary, the presented data did not alter my opinion for or against capital punishment.  ": 1,
          "One thing I immediately saw that was specific to the results was that the actual largest and therefore most significant difference in murder rates was in the two state pairs that did not support the conclusions of the study. It's not a large set but then neither is the entire sample size. /  / But more generally, this study does not impact my opinion at all simply because the difference between two states can be enormous and simply uniting them with respect to urban areas does not necessarily make control for anything. To say that the only causes for murder rates are the presence or absence of the death penalty and the amount of urbanization is, I think very naive. /  / Not to be too critical, I applaud the researchers for studying this issue and trying to shed more light on it but this is not enough evidence to really conclude anything. I think this would be a nice stepping stone for further research that accurately controls for other factors and compares states more evenly.": 1,
          "Only 4 of the 10 states reported a decrease in murder rates in the presence of a death penalty. That the researchers were able to replicate the findings of their original study using slightly different parameters only further enhances my belief that capital punishment doesn't act as a deterrent, at least not predictably and uniformly. ": 1,
          "Only certain facts were presented about how the study was conducted, so it's difficult to evaluate validity. However, the results, as presented, show that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder. Else, why would murder rates be consistently higher in states that have capital punishment compared to similar states which do not?": 1,
          "Out of the 14 states, 9 of them showed no decrease in the murder rate and for the other five states, it is not conclusive that the death penalty was the cause of the decreased murder rate.  Therefore, it is not clear that the death penalty is effective in deterring crime.": 1,
          "Perhaps it was just a personal bias. It seem to assert that Capital Punishment was largely ineffective as a deterrrent compared to the lack of it.": 1,
          "Prima facie, an increasing murder rate in most of the states that adopted the death penalty undermines the idea that it has a deterrent effect. Of course, you can't run controlled trials in an experiment like this, and there could be any number of third factors. For example, there was no evaluation of the statistical significance of the changes in murder rate. More years should have been studied; legal changes don't necessarily produce results in just one year.": 1,
          "Regarding the study I think that if they are going to accurately reflect the deterent rate all 50 states should be compared, not just 10. Just because those 10 states show one set of data, and you then used another 10 states there are still 30 states that are not being accounted for. In order to accurately determine homeless population in the US all the states are used, why not in studies such as this? In my opinion looking at the 20 people in the room with me at work and saying that half of us really like the color blue because we are wearing it while the other half don't like the color blue because they aren't wearing it and using that data to then say half of the company I work for like blue and the other does not isn't accurate because all persons were not taken into account. ": 1,
          "Since an equal number of states with and without capital punishment had lower or higher murder rates, there is no conclusive evidence that capital punishment serves as a deterrent. Since that is one of capital punishment supporters' biggest argument, I thought that it was interesting that no link was actually found.": 1,

          "Since the study showed no significant changes between the murder rates of states before and after the institution of capital punishment, critics against capital punishment can use the study to say that there should be no reason to have capital punishment at all, since it effectively does nothing and is unnecessarily cruel.": 1,

          "Since this study did not reveal any findings that show capital punishment does in fact affect the murder rate, I believe that capital punishment is not effective, especially in comparison to the ramifications of it. The study would have to show a significant decrease in murder rate to justify capital punishment. ": 1,
          "Since, in both studies, the states that had (and used) capital punishment saw fewer murders committed, the study implies a correlation between the capital punishment availability and the lower rates of murder.

However, there is a slight problem with causality here. Are those states with higher rates of murder more likely to enact a policy of capital punishment because of those murder rates? Is there a selection bias because of this? Because of these questions, the study still remains only interesting and slightly convincing. ": 1,

Far less than its opposition, in my opinion. ": 1,

The statistics show that murder rates actually increased in 11 of 14 states after the capital punishment was adopted or reinstated, however, the authors did not look at the fact that crime overall decreased.

In other words, it is possible that the murder rate could have been significantly higher, rather then just slightly higher in those states.": 1,

The concern about total crime rate drop is a definite variable that while addressed to an extent can royally mess with statistics.

The researchers presented the evidence that way, and that leads them to believe that capital punishment does nothing to deter murder rates.

          "The research showed that states using capital punishment had higher rates of homicide than their neighbors. Therefore we can conclude that the death penalty does not discourage people from committing homicides.": 1,
          "the researchers are aware that capital punishment can reduce crimes": 2,
          "The researchers are carefully selecting the states that they take into consideration. That means there might be a bias towards supporting the death penalty as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The researchers failed to reject the null hypothesis, which either means that there is truly no relationship between a state having the death penalty and the number of murders committed, or that a follow-up study is required. Here, the latter is clearly the case.": 1,
          "The results are definitely inconclusive. There was equal increase/decrease in murder rates, and then no change in the majority of the others. There was nothing overwhelming either way. ": 1,
          "The results did not prove anything.  ": 1,
          "The results of the study were inconclusive.  They would probably have to either study different states or other variables to come to a definitive conclusion.  ": 1,
          "The results show that about the same number of states had the murder number go down as had the murder number go up. The others had the murder number stay the same. No trend stands out about murders increasing or decreasing as a result of capital punishment being reinstated. The evidence just isn't there to support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "the results showed little difference in states that had capital punishment..": 1,
          "The results were 50/50 whether capital punishment showed a lower or higher crime rate.": 1,
          "The results were in conclusive, and when viewed along with the charts, it appears that the murder rates were nearly the same in each pair, with only a slight skew in either direction.": 1,
          "The results were inconclusive - some states had higher rates but the same number had lower rates. I'm also not sure that the cultural effects and repercussions of these laws would be felt or be effective as soon as a year or two after they were passed - perhaps it would be better to measure after 5 years, 10 years, etc.": 1,
          "The results were inconclusive. An equal number of states both decreased and increased in the murder rate before versus after capital punishment became legal, and four states experienced no change in murder rates before versus after capital punishment became legal. So, I feel the study didn't support the argument that capital punishment deters murders, because there is no conclusive evidence across all the states to show a decrease in the murder rate after capital punishment was legalized. If anything, the study shows capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate and doesn't deter individuals from killing.": 1,
          "The results were not convincing one way or the other. The study appeared to be from an unbiased perspective, and the results made it seem like there was not a significant difference between states that use capital punishment and those that do not.": 1,
          "The states that had capital punishment had higher murder rates, therefore showing that the deterrant effect is not relevant.": 1,
          "The statistic on its own definitely makes it look like capital punishment does not decrease murder rates, but it's just one statistic. You'd have to look at a lot of other statistics to back these claims up. Presumably, the actual study does include more supporting statistics, but from what I just read, I'm not particularly convinced of the authors' theory. These statistics could just be part of a larger trend, or there could be other factors at play here.": 1,
          "The statistics in this study show a somewhat convincing coorelation between the adoption of the death penalty and crime rate. The fact there are other variables that may be at work should warrant further testing however.": 1,
          "The statistics showed that it was better after they imposed the death penalty MORE times than not.  One could argue it didn't matter but if we are looking at statistics alone... it did matter.": 1,
          "The studies showed that capital punishment does not reduce crime in the majority of states which have implemented it (compared to other states which have not). I think this supports the argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The study  showed that it decreased murder rates sometimes but they went back up": 1,
          "The study argued that states with capital punishment had lower murder rates. When reviewing the data, I noticed the differences between the two states (in the pair) with regard to murder rates was sometimes very small and in other studies may not have qualified as significant enough to be considered a true difference. Therefore, I do not acutally believe believe that argument was supported. There was not enough of a difference between the state pairs to say that the the difference was attributable to capital punishment. The difference could simply be due to natural variation, which needs to be taken into consideration. Some leeway must be given for natural variation and other possible isues.": 1,
          "The study as presented tried to avoid including their political beliefs in the study and responded to criticism about the study by making corrections thought necessary to present an unbiased view of capital punishment.": 1,
          "The study attempted to support the argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent and I agree with the results because so many of the states saw a decrease the following year. However, the criticism against the study outweighs what the study found.": 1,
          "The study claims that the crime rates were lowered after the reinstatement of capital punishment, implying that capital punishment's presence was the cause of this decrease. This would mean it served as a deterrent to the murders.": 1,

          "The study concluded that states with capital punishment policies have higher murder rates so capital punishment does not deter murder.": 1,
          "The study controlled as many variables as it could between the pairs of states it compared and it still found that the majority of states that had capital punishment laws had lower homicide rates. It did a good job of controlling other factors and by replicating the study I think it shows very well that capital punishment does deter murder.": 1,
          "The study definitely doesn't support the hypothesis that capital punishment is a deterrent. While they did find many variations in the crime rate going both up and down in various states, there are far too many other factors that can influence crime rates which should be included in any studies to gain a clearer picture of what effect the laws themselves had. /  / I agree with the initial conclusion that the data as presented is indeterminate.": 1,
          "The study definitely looked like it did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder by practically showing results of neighboring states.  While if the results are true, then maybe capital punishment does not deter murder as much as one would want.  But one can still be for capital punishment even if it is not necessarily to deter murder.  As a person who supports capital punishment, it would be to just empty out prisons, and to give families of victims peace.  I don't think capital punishment does deter murder, but I'm for it.  The research seemed a like a huge estimation too.": 1,
          "The study did not more than show that their was a correlation between the death penalty and a lower murder rate. The study did absolutely nothing to prove causation.": 1,
          "The study did not show that there was a correlation between use of the death penalty and lower violent crime rates.": 1,
          "The study did not support capital punishment as a deterrent. It has shown that similar states that have common boarders have a higher crime rate in states with capital punishment. If capital punishment were a deterrent, the states with capital punishment would have lower crime rates. ": 1,
          "THE STUDY DID NOT SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OR WAS THAT IT WAS AGAINST IT.AFTER THE STUDY WAS OVER IT SHOWED 5 STATES SHOWED LOWER MURDER RATES,5 STATES SHOWED HIGHER MURDER RATES,AND 4 STATES SHOWED NO CHANGE.": 1,
          "the study did not support it because in reality capital punishment does not deter anyone.": 1,

          "The study did not support the argument for capital punishment because it demonstrated that the application of a death penalty law did not change the murder rate in neighboring states.  That suggests that there are other, more important factors, which influence the murder rate.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it clearly showed that murder rates didn't drop or stay the same after capital punishment was put into effect, but in fact increased. I don't think capital punishment is why the murders increased, but it obviously did not stop people from murdering.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, as the study showed that, on average, states with the death penalty actually had higher murder rates than states without the death penalty. ": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  The results were inconclusive.  These results help opponents of the death penalty.  It possibly takes away the argument that the death penalty makes people think twice before committing a murder.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  The study, in fact, showed that people appear to be more violent in states where capital punishment exists, as those states consistently had a higher murder rate.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is deterrent to murder because, although the pairs of states included were matched up and (apparently) very similar in all meaningful ways, most of the states with capital punishment had higher murder rates than did their matched neighbors.": 1,
          "The study did not support the death penalty. It showed that murders increased in 11/14 states after the capital punishment was implemented. ": 1,
          "the study did not support the deterrent to murde as most states had a higher rate of murder after capital punishment laws were enacted": 1,
          "The study did not validate capital punishment because there was no drastic change between the paired states.": 1,
          "The study did seem to suggest that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, based off of the data and graphs supplied. They believed this, so whenever people didn't believe them, they did the study yet again on a different sample. This leads me to believe they are out to prove that capital punishment is a detterent, and that they support this notion.": 1,
          "The study did seem to support the argument for capital punishment. On the surface numbers are convincing, but the points that critics raise are also something that I would like to read more about. looking at the study and without digging any further they do make their case.": 1,
          "The study did support the argument for capital punishment as a detterent to murder because it provided data that suggests having capital punishment reduces murders. It does not happen for all the cities but most, which is good enough.": 1,
          "the study did support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, because the data shows eight out of ten state with death penalty has a lower murder rate.": 1,
          "The study did support the argument. There was definitely a drop in crime over the years. ": 1,
          "The study did try to support the argument that capital punishment in a deterrent to murder by examining pairs of adjacent states that had similar proportions of people in urban populations and where one state had a 5 year existing capital punsihment law (that had been enacted) and one did not.  Therefore the presence of a capital punishment law could be argued as a deciding factor when other things had been normalized out. /  / I personally didn't buy the argument.   There's a huge bias potential in picking 'adjacent' states, since most states border a number of states, and the urban population normalization strongly suggests that murder rates are much higher in cities in the study than in non-urban areas.  If you're going to compare the murder rates in states, why not do it on a city by city basis, normalizing for size.  Also, the bar chart data clearly shows that there are states with a murder rate with capital punishment that are an order of magnitude greater than some states that do not have such a law on the books.": 1,
          "The study didn't take many factors into account so the data is pretty meaningless to me without context. as others mentioned overall crimerate is important, etc. the rises and falls in rates of murder werent very significant, so more study is certainly needed. i wouldnt reference this study to support either side of the argument.": 1,
          "The study does not prove with substantial evidence that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. There are too many other factors to consider other than simply capital punishment laws. There are socio economic factors, community programs, law enforcement, etc.": 1,

          "The study does not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, it actually proves otherwise, plainly. What the study doesn't take into consideration is that many people who support the death penalty don't support it as a deterrent, but as a recompense to those who suffered.": 1,
          "The study does not support the death penalty having a deterrent effect.  When neighboring states with and without the death penalty were compared, the murder rate was usually higher in the state with the death penalty in effect.  There is no evidence that capital punishment acts as a deterrent.": 1,
          "The study emphasized more of the states that did not have capital punishment and had lower murder rates than states that had higher murder rates and capital punishment.": 1,
          "The study essentially showed that capital punishment has no effect on changes in murder rates.  About half of states had rates go up, half had rates go down, and the rest remained unchanged.": 1,
          "The study found that states with capital punishment laws had marginally lower murder rates than neighboring states with no capital punishment. This supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because there were fewer murders in the states where capital punishment existed.": 1,
          "The study has good points but there are many other factors that probably would figure into a state's murder rates that were not considered in the study - so it would be one argument against capital punishment but not an all-inclusive one.": 1,
          "The study has statistics to prove that capital punishment does help as a deterrent to murder. With 8 out of 10 states having lower murder/crime rates than that of their neighboring state, i feel that the results are clear. As i have always thought, capital punishment will help lower murder/crime rates.": 1,
          "The study I just read is an argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder because it stated that in 11 or the 14 states where the death penalty was recently added, murder crimes in those states did not drop (as they should based on the reason for the law). In fact, in those 11 states, murder crimes actually rose over the course of the year. If crimes rise as a result of the capital punishment laws, the study essentially questioned why we have the laws to begin with.": 1,
          "The study I read didn't support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent of murder. It showed that there was no correlation between murder rates and states with capital punishment laws. The original study summary didn't provide a ton of information about the methods used so I wasn't to sure about the credibility of the study. In the second article and the fact that they repeated the study with similar results cleared some of my skepticism about the study. Also knowing how they paired state was critical to the validity of the study.": 1,

This study, like most studies on \\\\hot button\\\\ issues, is dismissed as conclusory/biased by those that are fundamentally against the conclusion.  Conversely, those that agree with the suggested result (that the death penalty has a good result - deterrent for murder), use it as support for their own position.  Abortion, gay marriage, global warming and death penalty issues, among others, are simply issues that require far more than a \\\\study\\\\ to change one's mind.  Generally, opinions pertaining to these issues are created through indoctrination, and it will require similar methods to alter existing opinions.": 1,

          "The study just showed the results of the murder rate before and after capital punishment without showing any other factors. That was the only data they needed to show it works. If they did not support capital punishment this data would be presented differently by showing capital punishment doesn't necessarily deter crime.": 1,

It is like they ignored the outside effects to publish a study in their beliefs. ": 1,
          "The study seemed to be attempting to isolate the effects of the death penalty without actually isolating them.

In other words, their study is missing a \\\\control\\\\ group.": 1,
          "The study seemed to be wrote from a biased perspective.  Other numbers besides the murder rate were brought into the equation.  The argument is strictly about murder rate in relation to the death penalty, and nothing else should be used to sway the answer either way.  I don't think the argument supported the point that capital punishment deters murder.": 1,

          "The study seemed to take enough factors into consideration to be a valid study. They controlled for a lot of factors. I think there was an issue with the 7/10 number, since the three that were opposite had a much larger difference than the 7 that were the same.": 1,

          "The study seems to support the argument because, even though the murder rates in 11 out of 14 states increased after the death penalty was allowed, other factors, especially crime rates, decreased, which means that out of the overall percentage of crime, the increase in murder rates would seem more significant when other crimes decrease.": 1,
          "The study should have taken more data into account.

The study demonstrates satisfactorily that the death penalty does not deter murder.": 1,

If this is the case, then it would seem to undermine one of the biggest arguments for capital punishment, in that it acts as a deterrent. Because it doesn't help prevent murders or keep the murder rate down, the argument for capital punishment would be severely weakened. ": 1,
          "The study shows that, in similar population, having a death penalty is coorelated with having a higher murder rate. This indicates that the death penalty does not deter criminals from murder. Another possibility is that states with a death penalty are more aggressive about crime, and murder rates are higher because murders in their sister states are under-reported. However, this seems dubious as murder is a crime that provokes high emotions from those who knew the victim, and from others who merely have heard of the crime via media. A policeman would be foolish to allow murders to slip through the cracks, although he might get away with not prosecuting jay walkers.": 1,

However, in the graph shown, it was clear that murder did not decrease due to the presence of capital punishment within a given state. Thus, due to the lack of intended deterrent effect, the use or enforcement of capital punishment has failed to produce the desired effect.  /  / Making a small logical leap from there, taking away apital punishment in those states will have no effect, the state will then essentially be the same as its neighboring state. As such, the study effectively shows that capital punishment is not an effective deterrent and may be discontinued in many states without consequence.": 1,

It is highly unlikely that it would have an effect on the murder rate. I believe this to be true because of the fact that when someone commits a murder they think they will not get caught. If you never get caught you will never have to face the death penalty. The death penalty is in place for people who we cannot release out into civilization ever again, and do not want to pay for. Why feed a child killer? Just give them the death penalty and save your money.": 1,
          "The study tried to support the argument that capital punishment is a deterent to murder using only one piece of information to come to this conclusion; murder rates.

          "The study was clearly outlined to show that having capital punishment laws coupled with the death penalty usage meant a higher murder rate. In the study it also pointed out that the mere existence of capital punishment laws does not stop murders from being committed at a slightly higher rate than those of states with no capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "The study was completely not favoring either side of the argument. It presented research that showed states having increase, decrease, or no change in the murder rate.

This would show that the death penalty has not reduced murders in states where it is in place.  However, the study did not show if the murder rate has gone down in those states from before having the death penalty.  It is only considering murder rates for one year versus another state.  Did the rates in those other states go up or down, or how about the rates in the death penalty states?  ": 1,

          "The study's results showed that capital punishment was not, in the majority of states studied, a deterrent to murder. If it was a deterrent to murder, one would expect to see lower murder rates in states with active capital punishment. Since the data showed that the murder rates were actually higher in the states with active capital punishment, the argument that capital punishments deters murder falls apart.": 1,
          "The tried to show lower murder rates in areas with death penalty to be lower, making it an effective deterrent to capitol crimes. ": 1,
          "Their data shows in some cases, the murder rate were the same, or higher after capital punishment was implemented.  If they support the death penalty they would be unlikely to raise these points, as it shows it's ineffective.": 1,
          "Their seemed to be information About the 11 of the 14 states that had an increase in murder rates after the induction of capitol punishment, but there also seemed to information saying that there were factors that had not been included in the statistics(from what i could understand).": 1,
          "There are clearly other factors in play. The authors were unable to prove a clear connection to crime and capital punishment. ": 1,
          "There are equal amount of states that the murder rate was decreasd x and increased.  It did. Ot seem to affect a significant change in rates.": 1,
          "There are far too many factors that could explain the increase in the murder rate that have nothing to do with the death penalty. Furthermore, we are not shown the murder rate for states without the death penalty for comparison. Perhaps the rate increased at an even higher rate in those states. Lastly, one year is nowhere near enough time to judge the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent. Many people would not even be aware of the change and there was probably yet to be a death sentence given, and any actual execution would certainly be a minimum of a decade away still.": 1,
          "There are many factors other than capital punishment that could be the cause of the increase in crime over the course of the study.": 1,
          "There are so many parameters not controlled for that it seems difficult to draw any conclusion from this tudy.": 1,
          "There are so many variables that could have cause a murder rate to go up or down. I do see how they can definitively say that the death penalty is not a deterrent based on the murder rates of 14 states after a year.  I personally agree, the death penalty should be abolished and don't think it serves as a deterrent, but this study is inconclusive in my mind.": 1,
          "There can be a lot of factors influencing murder rate. I would say there needs to be extensive research done to rule out extraneous variables. The difference in the change in murder was not very significant either leading me to believe it might just be a fluke of some other variable.": 1,
          "There could be many factors in the murder rates. Correlation does not imply causation.": 1,
          "There is no evidence to show that these two factors are directly related. Just because capital punishment is the law and crime is higher does not mean that capital punishment leads to higher crime rate. It could mean that higher crime rate leads to acceptance of capital punishment.": 1,
          "There simply was no information presented which would indicate a bias one way or the other towards capital punishment, including the results themselves.": 1,
          "There was no change, or an increase in murder rates, in more states than not. There was no overwhelming evidence to show that the death penalty was a deterrent.": 1,
          "There was no clear evidence that capital punishment had an effect, so it provides no justification for the death penalty.": 1,
          "There was no evidence in either the initial study or the follow-up that there was a consistent reduction in murder rates in states with capital punishment when compared to adjoining states without. ": 1,
          "There was no pattern that suggested that states with capital punishment would have a lower murder rate. ": 1,
          "There was not overwhelming evidence to conclude either argument.": 1,
          "There was nothing in the study showing that the decline in murder rates was actually linked to the implementation of capital punishment and it didn't account for the overall decline in crime rates. The study doesn't really show anything definitively.": 1,
          "There was very little change in the murder rate in the majority of the states tested; therefore, capital punishment did not have an effect on the murder rate.": 1,
          "There were a lot of factors that the authors of the study did not take into consideration.": 1,
          "There were more murders in states with capital punishment": 1,
          "There were not enough data points and the time span was not wide enough. Also, in some states the murder rate increased.": 1,
          "There were statistics saying crime went up which i dont agree": 1,
          "They didn't really give any counter arguments. It seemed biased against capital punishment.": 1,
          "They keep mentioning that the study says that capital punishment states have a higher murder rate": 1,
          "They make is sound like the laws on capital punishment are the only factor in crime rate.  Dozen of variables would need to be taken into account to try an accurately determine deterrents to crime rates": 1,
          "They predicted that murder rates would be lower in states with capital punishment laws; this is wishful thinking which is supporting the efficacy of capital punishment.": 1,
          "They said that capital punishment upped crime in places where it was used.": 1,
          "They showed the percantage rate of lowered murders they may not have disclosed about the parole info but that was not the same across the board": 1,
          "They utilized the data sets to make a sound case against the efficacy of capital punishment. Murder rates are higher than before adoption capital punishment.  ": 1,
          "They were biased towards one conclusion in ways so maybe the data should be questioned.": 1,
          "This is such an amazingly shallow study it makes my teeth hurt. I can't really think of any two states in the US that are so similar that they could be compared in such a brazenly simplistic manner. I could make a strong argument that higher murder rates might encourage certain states to enact death penalty legislation, whereas more peaceful states might repeal their death penalty statute. In this case, the stats would be the opposite of what the researchers found.  /  / The only thing I about for certain about capital punishment being a deterrent is that dead criminals can't commit any more crimes. I can't speak to the rest of society, but I can guarantee that the execution certainly deters the executed.": 1,
          "This shows that capital punishment has no effect, making it an ineffective deterrent.": 1,
          "This study definately tried to show that capital punishment was not a deterrent to murder. By having 11 out of 14 states show that murder rates increased after the adoption of capital punishment, it is very hard to argue the case of the death penalty scaring offender's with data like this.": 1,
          "This study proves nothing.  The murder rate still maintain the same average (if you considered all 10 states, not 1 at a time).  Other factors need to be factored in and it should be done on a state by state (individual states not a group of states) bases.": 1,
          "This study really only stated that capital punishment might be a deterrent to murder; in five states that number of murders dropped, but in 5 other states the murder rate rose, and the rest of the states saw no change. So if I had to say for or against capital punishment I would have to say this argues more against capital punishment serving as a deterrent to murder because rates did rise in certain states but honestly the study seems inconclusive to me.": 1,
          "This study shows that 11 out of 14 states that initiated the death penalty did not experience a drop in murder rates, signifying capital punishment is not a good deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "This type of data seems easy to manipulate.  Despite attempts at demographic consistency, the fact remains that the samples were cherry picked.  Additionally, the fact that death sentences are selectively applied even in states that legally support capital punishment should be taken into consideration when making this argument.": 1,
          "To me, the study seemed to show that capital punishment is not correlated to the murder rate, and therefore would not act as a deterrent.  The murder rate rose in some states, fell in others, and stayed the same in others.": 1,
          "To put it simply, they admitted that the study's results were inconclusive.  That means it cannot support either opinion.  It is a result, but it is not one useful to either of those purposes.": 1,
          "To support the death penalty there needs to be a statistically significant drop in the crime rate, even a slight hint of one is not enough to swing one way or the other.  Without any significant drop then the noise from other variables like parole procedures they mentioned is too much to draw a conclusion one way ot the other. ": 1,
          "Too little information to determine anything either way really": 1,
          "Urbanization and other factors being roughly equal, there were higher murder rates in the states with capital punishment, versus lower murder rates in the states without capital punishment.  Given that the study was conducted on a second set of ten states, with similar results, I would say that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "Usually academic studies do not involve politics in it and the people who initiate the academic studies are interested in an answer for a particular question of interest. The results that were derived do not seem to be modified in any way for bias of one side": 1,
          "Violent crimes appear to rise in states that adopt the death penalty.": 1,
          "We are showed via the presented research that the presence of capital punishment does not have a significant effect on murder rates versus the absence of capital punishment. ": 1,
          "Well after looking at the results the states that had capital punishment actually had slightly higher murder rates than the ones that didn't. The study was meant to basically prove that capital punishment worked and it failed to do so. So I feel that because of the study maybe capital punishment should be looked over again. ": 1,
          "Well at first I was like cool.  The fact are stated but then the study said many other factor contribute to less murder rates.  Like just lower crime in general and it wasn't the adoption of the death penalty.  I think when people murder other people they do it for hate and don't think about the consequences. Most people would rather cover up a crime by killing someone then risk getting 10 years in prison,. ": 1,
          "well if murder rates keep going down then it would be more evidence": 1,
          "Well the results weren't conclusive to me, but it did show that changing the captial punishment laws did not have such a strong effect.": 1,
          "Well, honestly, there cannot be a definite answer about it. Both arguments show evidence either way.": 1,
          "Well, I think there evidence was intriguing and maybe could be pointing out something, however, from what I read it was only done from statistics in 2010, so maybe that year just happened to be that way? I think if they continued to do evidence throughout many more years then they would have more conclusive evidence.": 1,
          "Well, it showed the numbers. Apparently there are less murders in states with capital punishment.": 1,
          "Well, it's clear by the graph data. 8 of the 10 pairs of states the murder rate was higher in the states with capitol punishment, and lower in the states without. This clearly shows that capital punishment doesn't do ANYTHING to deter crime rates. Palmer and Crandall proved this point perfectly with the graph data. ": 1,
          "Well, they only produced statistics for one year?  That's sort of a big limitation.  And what did they control for in that teeny tiny year?  Crime is usually driven by the economy - that's just a terrible design.  I don't get what the parole changes have to do with anything.  Is the argument that parolees might reoffend with murder?  In a YEAR?  Most folks get rearrested, but many hang on for more than 12 months.  So, I don't get the critique, either.  I'm very opposed to the death penalty - and I think this result is not helpful in the  least.  ": 1,
          "What where the p and r values? Were the results statistically significant? The researchers also did not consider and account for other factors.": 1,
          "When you saw the numbers, you realize that instating the death policy really did very little do change murder rates; even in states where there was an increase or decrease, it was often negligible. The states that already had low murder rates still had low ones, and the ones that had high rates still had high rates. Very little changed altogether, so the study did not support any kind of argument, one way or another.": 1,
          "Whether a state has capital punishment or not does not change the murder rate therefore capital punishment is not a deterrent. ": 1,
          "While generally speaking, the murder rate had lowered in many of the states, in most cases the decrease was fairly minor, and in other cases the rate had actually increased.  Also, I think the study has too narrow a focus.  The change in the numbers could have been caused by many things.  It's a classic case of correlation being passed off as causality.  The study theoretically could be proof of that, but I think a great deal more research would need to be done before it could be argued with reasonable certainty that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder.   ": 1,
          "While I would liked to believe this study there was not really any supporting evidence rather just unfounded sentiment.": 1,
          "While opponents could use this to demonstrate that it there was no effect on the crime rate as states with capital punishment were equally likely to have a higher or lower crime rate than ones who did not.": 1,
          "While the study was conducted in a logical and unbiased way, as far as I can tell, while they say that  the data is inconclusive, I desagree. Considering the fact that the overall murder rate realativly stayed the same when you average out the 14 states that made changes to the law regauarding capital punishment, I think their is more credience to the argument that capital punishment does not deter murder.": 1,
          "Why i thought it didnt. Becuase there are still murders today and its not right to take life no matter what": 1,
          "With all things being equal (researchers tried to eliminate bias factors such as urban areas), they have showed over 2 studies that a definite majority of the states showed a correlation between using the death penalty and lower murder rates.": 1,
          "With capital punishment in effect, you know that there is a more severe punishment to the acts that one person does and the states that use capital punishment have typically seen a downward trend of less crime/murders, this is why I support capital punishment, actions should have consequences. ": 1,
          "With the results being inconclusive the argument that capital punishment deters murders is less valid. If it was true that capital punishment deters crime it would be observed to do so in each state with the death penalty.": 1,
          "Without a historical perspective, a one-year difference in murder rates may not mean much, especially if, in most cases where rates dropped, they dropped by such a small amount.  I feel that without additional data, their results can't be considered a clean-cut endorsement of capital punishment, and with numbers for previous years being available, I have to wonder why they weren't included in order to assuage this particular criticism.": 1,
          "Without knowing more about the study, it is impossible to lend credibility to it.  Quick math tells me that more than likely this study doesn't exist...some of the murder rates (which are normally measured in #/100,000) moves by a tenth of a point. That's 100 murders. I don't recall all of the numbers off the top of my head, but it would seem that if the trend held up, it would equate to thousands or even tens of thousands more murders.  / So assuming it is being offered for this study only...There is too much information that should be taken into account that I was not presented with. Even weather can have an effect on violent crime (as we saw this past winter). Why was the study only concentrating on 11 of 14 states? Last I checked The United States consisted of 50. Was the data cherry picked? Again, too many questions to form an actual opinion.": 1,
          "Without seeing the the original study, it felt like the authors were defending the conclusion, and when any new data came in, they were not willing to consider their original hypothesis could have been wrong. /  / Statistically murder may have gone down, but how many people in the heat of the moment of crime consider the punishment they may receive? Removing lead from our paint and gasoline may have done far more to reduce murder.": 1

          "One cannot argue with numbers. It is pretty clear that the evidence shows that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder based on the evidence shown.": 1,
          "They didn't pick states with equal starting conditions. The states were not similar and cannot be compared.": 1,
          "This argument seemed like it had convincing data regarding the increase of crime when capital punishment was instated, but with other laws enacted at the same time, it seems like the results might change if they were taken into account. ": 1,
          "The study does not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the murder rate is higher after capital punishment laws went into effect in most of the states they looked at.": 1,
          "While we seem to see a general trend that the implentation of the deathc penalty has lowered murder rates in most states, the differences were, mostly, minimal differences. This changes may not be outside the normal range of rate change from year to year.": 1,
          "It sounds like this was a study that was carried out very comprehensively. They used neighboring states with different capital punishment laws. When critics of the study said a different selection of states would yield different results, they did a study with a different selection and the results were similar.": 1,
          "They showed were in favor by showing a decrease in murders in areas that had started useing a death penalty.": 1,
          "The actual #s did not take statistical variations into account. ": 1,
          "It supported the argument for capital punishment by showing that states with capital punishment have lower murder rates. In ten sets of comparable states, the ones with the death penalty had lower murder rates 8 out of 10 times.": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. Although I do believe critics of the study when they say multiple factors played a role in the changing murder rates in the states studied, if capital punishment was a true deterrent, then you would see a clear pattern of decreased murder rates in states that adopted it. That is not the case. ": 1,
          "It showed that that states had fewer murders with the death penalty": 1,
          "It does not support capital punishment as a deterrent. States which use capital punishment had a higher rate than a neighboring state without, 8 our of ten times. Further research showed essentially the same result. In other words, the murder rate is higher in states with capital punishment, generally.  ": 1,
          "Capital punishment isn't good for a person who committed murder.  Just because one murder is committed doesn't mean another murder should be made to take place of that.": 1,
          "Kroner and Phillips noticed that in the pat twelve years, 14 states have cleared capital punishment laws. They thought thta if capital punishment laws were to infact prevent murders, the rate should have been much bigger for the year before adoption of the death penalty than for the year after the adopition of capital punishment in those states. ": 1,
          "The study showed how capital punishment did not seem to alter the effect of crime rate. Also, parole seemed to play a larger factor in the study and how the states laws were established, making it more difficult to know what exactly helped the crime and what didn't.": 1,
          "The study could have included more time and maybe even more states but I think the judgment about it is sound at this time. ": 1,
          "Again, it showed that the murder rate in states with cap punishment had lower murder rate.": 1,
          "The study did not show a decrease in murders after the adoption of the death penalty in the states examined.  ": 1,
          "The study concluded those states with death penalty have higher rates of murder compared to states without death penalty. I think it refute the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I think the study tried to argue that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder. They presented evidence that it had an inconclusive impact on the murder rate.  Their methodology seemed a bit weak, so I think they were trying to reach that conclusion.": 1,
          "The states with and without capital  punishment were too evenly matched in their results to say there was definite evidence one way or the other. I think this study only proved it is too close to call.": 1,
          "i guess they are trying to determinate the impact and they are not in favor": 1,
          "I don't think this study presented material that either supported or was against capital punishment. Rather,  I think it's somewhere in the middle. Since almost all of the states had small percentage changes either up or down, there's not really any conclusive evidence here.": 1,
          "I think the study supported the deterrent of murder because they proveded valuable information about the states. I think murder was also a deterrent because many of the states also adopted harsher parole rules. ": 1,
          "I don't think the study did a very good job of supporting capital punishment as a deterrent to murder, because there are other factors that could have lowered the murder rate. Perhaps capital punishment and murder rates are correlated, but that does not mean the threat of capital punishment causes the murder rate to drop.": 1,
          "Again, even though the researchers in this case tried to control for every possibility, the results were the same with an equal number of states whose murders rates rose and fell and two whose rates were neutral.  This leaves the determination of the evidence that capital punishment deters crime is still inconclusive.": 1,
          "I think this study was thought out much better than the previous study, and it's comparisons were more useful.  I would agree that this data does not support the notion that capital punishment reduces murder rates.  It does however, lack credibility in that it only looks at a point by point comparison for 2012.  I would also argue that the reasoning on both sides of the argument that individuals who are about to murder another human take time to make a logical choice about whether or not to proceed based on the laws in their state is foolish.  In summary, if I was trying to decide if capital punishment in a state lowered the murder rates, I would be inlined to think it did not based on this information.": 1,
          "After careful consideration or the evidence or lack thereof I really don't think that a murderer gives any consideration about the death penalty. I am going back to a neutral position on this.": 1,
          "This study proved absolutely nothing other than it seems to make no difference. Results were literally split down the middle. While performed quite well, and an interesting study, the results only seem to prove that capital punishment doesn't affect anything.": 1,
          "The only variable.they included was the existence of capital punishment  in determining  murder rate and did not consider anything else, especially to look for other reasons the murder rate was lower in a few instances.": 1,
          "The study explored neighboring states with different capital punishment laws. The states that had the death penelty experienced higher murder rates than states that did not have the death penalty..": 1,
          "This study more clearly shows the non-effect of capital punishment than the first study. Since 8 out of 10 pairs show that states that institute capital punishment actually have higher murder rates than their non-capital punishment counterparts, it seems to be that capital punishment does not deter potential murders.": 1,
          "The study looked at neighboring states where 1 state had capital punishment and the other didn't, and found that murder rates were consistently lower (8 out of 10 times) in the state that had capital punishment. Again, there could possibly be other explanations for this, but among the more likely explanations would be that capital punishment is in fact a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The study supports the capital punishment argument due to the evidence of states with capital punishment having a lower crime rate than their neighboring states that don't allow capital punishment, with eight of of ten pairs of states showing a reduction in murder.": 1,
          "They didn't consider other factors and the study says there are more murders after the death penalty.": 1,
          "Most states were very close.  I still believe capital punishment does not  deter crime enough.": 1,
          "It seemed to support not capital punishment again.  It doesn't take into consideration the increase of population, and other aspects. There are cities with much greater crime rates than others.  It's hard to believe that death penalty will not reduce murder rates, but then again murderers have nothing to lose.": 1,
          "The study indicated that capital punishment worked to lower the murder rate in states. They seemed to account for differences between states and had similiar results when comparing other states in a second study. The study would have been better if they had shown similarities between murder rates in states that were similar and had the same murder penalties as a control. ": 1,
          "DID NOT SOPORT, THEY PICKED WHAT WAS INLINE WITH THEM": 1,
          "This one is even more outrageous, especially considering it's only 2 years totaled being monitored. I could see those values raise and lower year to year anyway. They are still trying to negate the effectiveness of the death penalty.": 1,
          "The study shows the Before and After of the installation of capital punishment. It is different from the other survey in the fact that it only compares an area to itself instead of to another area.": 1,
          "This study supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it shows comparisons between murder rates in states that recently adopted the death penalty. In every state, the murder rate dropped compared to the year before the death penalty was adopted.": 1,
          "It's weird how the same study showed different results": 1,
          "The previous study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent for murder because it argued that the year before capital punishment was introduced, there were fewer murders than the year after its introduction, thus, it didn't prevent murders at all.": 1,
          "I don't believe it supported or did not support, since the results were almost totally inconclusive.": 1,
          "Same as before. An exact split down the middle. ": 1,
          "I was not convinced that the death penalty has any effect on murder rates. The rates were all over the place, some much higher than others. I didn't see any evidence of any relationship between the existence, or not, of capital punishment and the murder rates.": 1,
          "It is proof that the capital punishment doesn't work as a deterrent.": 1,
          "This study attempts to show that the presence of capital punishment laws actually spikes murder rates. ": 1,
          "They were presenting assumptions about people being less able to bail in states where capitol punishment was lower. They also mentioned that crimes reduced.": 1,
          "It seems that when criminals understand that they may be put to death for committing murder, they think twice.  Stricter punishment works, even if its tougher parole.": 1,
          "Murder rates were lower in many cities that adopted capital punishment.": 1,
          "They argued it as a deterrant for crimes.": 1,
          "Having it split so equally, with murder rates going down in 5 states and up in 5, I don't think this study provided enough proof to show that capital punishment was OR was not a deterrent to murder. ": 1,
          "Again, the evidence in this study shows that the death penalty did not reduce the murder rate from one year to the next.  This would show that the death penalty is not deterring anyone from committing murder.  However, the death penalty would have been put in place in the years used in the study, but not shown yet or possibly been sentenced even.  A new study showing the rates after sentencing of murderers to the death penalty and the penalty actually being used would show possibly different numbers.": 1,
          "By pairing neighboring states with similar rates of urbanization, but different capital punishment laws, they made a useful and convincing comparison. By adding ten more pairs of states to answer critics, and finding the same results, it became even more convincing. While the study does not absolutely prove that capital punishment deters murder, it certainly suggests it.": 1,
          "This study is about the same as the first one, except it takes population and other factors into account, making the results more linear. It was also repeated with different sets of states and the results were the same.": 1,
          "They did the same as the other researchers and believe that the murder rates were lower in states that had death penalties.": 1,
          "The study replicated its results with a different set of states.  It was conducted over a longer period, and used states that actually acted on their death penalty legislation.   /  / One of the questions for me has always been whether the existence of the death penalty itself cheapens the idea of human life in the first place.  If the state has a policy that life is too valuable to subject even heinous criminals to execution, then it tends to raise the value of life overall.  If execution is implemented on a widespread level, it shows that the state (and its citizens) have little consideration for life.": 1,
          "There was a pretty solid lack of a conclusion based on the study done. It didn't give any conclusive information at all.": 1,
          "they shouldnt have chosen such a close group of states or even if they did make sure the laws are similar": 1,
          "There is no way to correct for all of the factors in this study, like alterations in laws governing parole, or a poor economy leading to more crime (which could in turn result in a higher murder rate). It's impossible to directly correlate a rise in the murder rate with the change of a single state law. Therefore, this is not a scientific study and is merely supposition.": 1,
          "Again, I thought the data didn't show any conclusive evidence that capital punishment was a deterrent or not a deterrent.  It seemed like it was too close to call it any way.": 1,
          "Again, I felt that the evidence did not weigh heavily on either side of the issue, and the results were fairly even.": 1,
          "Actually, I think this study supports the argument against captial punishment better than the previous one. You are comparing one state to itself over time, with presumably similar population characteristics, rather than trying to compare different states.": 1,
          "I believe it did not support the argument. Of course they tried comparison of states and tried to make it even by accounting for urbanization, but there are still other things that effect each state in a different way. With comparisons between bordering states, most states with capital punishment did show an increased rate of murder. But each state can not be treated as equal not to mention 10 test subjects cannot determine if something is true or not.": 1,
          "The study showed that capital punishment had an inconclusive effect on murder rates.  ": 1,
          "While the results seem to correlate the death penalty with lower crime rates they do not appear to be significantly changed and correlation is not causation. ": 1,
          "I think it did not support but that the study was very flawed. A 2 year period of time is not enough to try and draw any correlation because a lot of factors were not considered.": 1,
          "It did not support the deterrent conclusion because it showed neighboring and similar states seem to trend towards a higher murder rate with the death penalty than without. ": 1,
          "The additional study where they checked other states without the death penalty but bordered it still went up in crime as well.": 1,
          "The study was almost entirely focused on reasons for the death penalty as a deterrent. The study did not seem as legitimate due to the selection nature of the study. That made me feel as though the results could have been skewed based on the location changing. Since the study presented more information in favor of, I wondered if the conductors of the study choose those location on purpose.  ": 1,
          "The study was a total joke as a scientific endeavor.  You don't take two years in a vacuum and use that to prove anything.  Crime rates aren't flat, they change year to year, and this study made no effort to include the data on how the murder rate had changed year to year before any reinstatement of the death penalty.  It sound like a Fox News investigation, let's find numbers that support our side and do nothing to put them in context.": 1,
          "It did support it by showing how states that support the death penalty have a lower murder rate compared to those that do not under certain controlled circumstances. ": 1,
          "The study clearly showed that in eight out of ten states with capital punishment the murder rates were higher than when they didn't have capital punishment.": 1,
          "This study did a good job of trying only to compare similar states, which should help to account for many extra factors which could affect crime rates. The fact that there is no clear lowering of the crime rates in states with the death penalty should be sufficient to show that any reduction in crime they may cause (whatever small effect that may be) absolutely does not justify the practice of execution.": 1,
          "This study is more convincing that the first one, but I still am not totally convinced. There are always more factors at play when talking about crime rate than a single act of legislation. ": 1,
          "The study even stated that the research it presented did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. The evidence and graphs showed that there were more murders in states that adopted capital punishment.": 1,
          "It did not support capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. The showed that in 8/10 and 7/10 bordering states had higher murder rates if they had the death penalty.": 1,
          "as i see how they designed this study it makes me belive that": 1,
          "The new study again shows that the deterrent effect of capital punishment is overstated, at least in the short term, therefor would weaken the argument for capital punishment.": 1,
          "They examined a fair number of states and by looking at adjoining pairs they helped to reduce the effect regional and sub-cultural differences might have on the results..  Though no mention was made about how many of the original 20 states were also used when the study was successfully replicated, the fact that it was successfully replicated with different pairings is provocative (I'm a little reserved on this point, though as they said different pairings not states).  I think all of the preceding shows an attempt at taking a representative sample.  The fact that they tried to control for outside factors like urban density is also the mark of better testing procedure.  They also chose only those states where the murder laws had been in place for at least 5 years, eliminating the possibility of a temporary aberration in the figures.   Interestingly enough, the difference in murder rates are even greater here than in the first study,, suggesting a greater statistical significance.  All this makes their findings more trustworthy.": 1,
          "This one showed neither because the data was all over the place.": 1,
          "This study included only some factors that measured crime rates. A more extensive study would have yielded very different results.": 1,
          "It showed that capital unishment had no effect on murder rates": 1,
          "The study, in my opinion, shows that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder, as in several states, the murder rate actually increased after capital punishment was adopted. ": 1,
          "This study makes a slightly stronger case in that the results were replicated when applied to different states. ": 1,
          "The number of crimes committed when death penalty was adopted ": 1,
          "When capital punishment was implemented, it was actually coorelated with an increase in murder. This was the very oposite of the intended effect.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. Since the results are inconclusive, I think that is shows that this study is not able to fully support the argument. ": 1,
          "the studies didnt seem to make sense to me": 1,
          "Again I don't think the study was done very well. There are quite a few other things to consider instead of just murder rates. What about other violent and non-violent crimes?": 1,
          "It clearly opposes the death penalty as a deterrent, because the states with the death penalty have higher murder rates than those without the death penalty ": 1,
          "This study shows the effectiveness of capital punishment.": 1,
          "It seems like the confidence that this data is correct is somewhat artifically high. It appears there may be many factors that could invalidate this data, but the researchers seem keen on confidently claiming this data supports the notion that the death penalty is a deterrent, regardless.": 1,
          "They pointed out statistics that said that the murder rate went down, in all but one state, I think state K, after the capital punishment law went into effect. They think that the rates going down is evidence that capital punishment is effective, because would-be criminals know that it's a possibility.": 1,
          "In 11 of 14 states, the murder rate was higher after adoption or reintroduction of capital punishment. This is strong evidence that there is not a deterrent effect.": 1,
          "The study is so poorly done that it would likely lower a reader's faith in capital punishment as a deterrent.": 1,
          "It is not a large difference in murder rates to justify killing another person. ": 1,
          "The study showed that the effect of capital punishment on the murder rate is inconclusive.  The results were split about 50/50 in favor and against the hypothesis.": 1,
          "The study seemed to support capital punishment because the results showed lower murder rates after capital punishment was voted into law.": 1,
          "I think the author felt no specific way. His writings made it sound like he did not have vested interest in either. ": 1,
          "The study took a more holistic approach for gathering data and deciphering it. They presented their evidence in a more neutral tone and came to a conclusion based on the evidence.": 1,
          "As critics pointed out, there are other important factors not considered by the study - and in any case, the results of the study are inconclusive at best regarding capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "a": 1,
          "I believe that the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it provided enough evidence to support my prior beliefs.": 1,
          "I think in this study, the researchers were looking to prove the argument of capital punishment would be a deterrent to murder but the statistics really didn't clearly show this. As many states had more crime after the installment of the death penalty, I found it to be unconvincing in this study.": 1,
          "The evidence that it was based on was insignificant and wasn't based on enough facts. There were other factors that could leave the study either way.": 1,
          "I feel like the article was geared owards finding ways to punish criminals other than the death penalty": 1,
          "Even after instating capital punishment, murder rates went up (although barely). I think it's more likely that capital punishment has nearly no effect at all at deterring crimes.": 1,
          "This particular study seemed unbiased.": 1,
          "It seems to be a good study. It looks to be done with care. It may be true that the criminals may be afraid of the death penalty. I think someone that is going to commit murder though does not really care.": 1,
          "This research clearly depicted capital punishment failing, having actually higher murder rates,": 1,
          "Two unbiased researchers compared data of ten different states using slightly different criteria and the results showed a decrease in capital punishment.   ": 1,
          "As mentioned in the response to the prior study, there are many different aspects and variations surrounding this issue that need consideration. Legislation alone is not enough to determine an answer to the capital punishment argument with much confidence.": 1,
          "Although I felt that the study did not consider enough variables with regards to how they compared states, it did not bring forward any evidence in support of the death penalty. One could question the veracity of the claim that death penalties increased the murder rate, however.": 1,
          "The states being compared were purposely chosen to have the same type of economic influence (eg. high or low poverty levels) which seems like a much more accurate way of measuring the data than the first study.": 1,
          "I thought this study was much better done than the first one that was presented. It seems to strongly support the argument that capital punishment IS a deterrent to murder and I like that the main criticism with the study was answered with a replication that involved a separate set of states. I think the researchers who authored this study favored the death penalty, but it seems possible that they were neutral on the matter.": 1,
          "There are more factors other than capital punishment that determines crime rates.": 1,
          "It is in my opinion that the results of the study became invalid when the researchers \\\\\" compiled a list of all possible pairs of states that had active capital punishment and selected ten pairs of neighboring states that were alike in the degree of urbanization (percentage of the population living in metropolitan areas) in an attempt to control any relationship between the size of urban population and crime per capita\\\"\\\".  There would be many other factors that would impact the violent crime statistic besides living in an urban metropolitan environment including individual and socio-economical influences; poverty, upbringing, education, mental health, illness etc.  \"": 1,
          "This study is meant to be for capitol punishment, but the critiques of the study point out a lot of flaws that make the study seem very ineffective. So, after looking at both, I would say it leans more against capitol punishment.": 1,
          "What were the p and r values? Were the results statistically significant? The researchers should have accounted for more factors, not just degree of urbanization. Like the previous study, this one was not very well done (and hence does not make a good argument).": 1,
          "The murder rate rose slightly in 11 of the 14 states after the death penalty laws, so this could be an argument against the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think that the study negated the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it showed that murder rates were higher in states with capital punishment, and the survey was conducted two times. ": 1,
          "The changes were negligible in the states that adopted capital punishment. In fact, the states with the opposite pattern seemed to have more drastic fluctuations in rates. In the states where capital punishment WAS adopted and rates dropped, the difference is so small it could very well be a natural fluctuation. ": 1,
          "Again, I believe the researchers tried to show an unbiased study and they didn't necessarily support or oppose the death penalty, and tried to support that by including more demographical than what I saw in the other study. ": 1,
          "Variables such as urbanization WERE included in thge study and the study was duplicated with similar results using ten different pairs of cities": 1,
          "It supported the argument against capital punishment by showing a reaction to the new laws, rather that blind statistics in different states.  ": 1,
          "I feel like it was less biasly worded, but yes, again it shows research that deters the possibility of capital punishment deterring murder rates.": 1,
          "My main problem with the study was that while two cities or states may seem similar, they are in fact always different. Just because one city has capital punishment may not be the only factor in why it may or may not have a lower murder rate. ": 1,
          "Regardless of whether there were stricter or more lenient parole laws, the overall evidence doesn't show a significant difference in murder rates from before or after the enactment of capital punishment.": 1,
          "Again, no significance statistics and didn't look like they ruled out other factors.  Correlation does not equal causation.": 1,
          "no idea": 1,
          "I thought that the approach was very interesting and novel.  I found the data to be quite profound.  It was interesting, however, that the two states that were the outliers were so far off in their comparison.  I would have liked to have known why those two states were so different than the others.": 1,
          "The study seemed very well done, and the authors didn't appear to have a bias. It looks like they carefully controlled for the most important variables. Better still, the results were replicated in another experiement. An unbiased, well run study with replicatable results is fairly convincing. As both studies found that murder rates were not lower in most of the states without capital punishment, and this is a decent piece of evidence against the deterrent effect of capital punishment.": 1,
          "According to the evidence, States with the death penalty have a higher murder rate": 1,
          "It showed that the murder rates went down after adopting the death penalty so obviously it supports it.": 1,
          "the study showed in two analysis that the murder rate was lower in states that o not have captiol punishment": 1,
          "Neighboring states did have lower murder rates if they had capital punishment. I don't think this study is taking a wide enough scope on the states they chose. In a pair of states laws can be quite different as well as living conditions. To say you are comparing apples to apples is just silly.": 1,
          "As with the previous study, this one also showed that capital punishment is an ineffective deterrent to crime.": 1,
          "these two studies seemed to have taken more outboundaries and information into consideration": 1,
          "By looking at states that share a border and are more similar, with the execption of their capital punishment laws, it does seem to affect murder rates.": 1,
          "It showed that in states without capital punishment, that murder rates were lower by a significant margin. ": 1,
          "I think the researchers were trying to show that capital punishment worked and in doing so, may have made it seem more favorable to that point than it really was.  A couple of the areas showed increases and the decreases were very slight.  As some of the critics said, there were also a lot of variables they didn't account for in making their argument. ": 1,
          "The problem is that there is selection bias in deciding which 2 states to link together.  This makes it so that the reasercher can choose pairs that will support his hypothesis.  ": 1,
          "It seems like those states that recently adopt the death penalty have an INCREASE in murder rates, which doesn't really make sense. I'm not sure if the two are directly corralated but I would vote against adopting the death penalty in this case.": 1,
          "I don't think that it supported the argument very well. There's a lot more to consider than urbanization in two different states. There is so much context that could change crime rates. If three of the states were Souther/border states, for example, those states have more crime.": 1,
          "It didn't seem like there was any bias at all.  They reproduced the results with different states, and the results were the same.  The way things were worded didn't lead me to believe that there was any bias.": 1,
          "With results showing that areas in similar vicinities showed rates of higher crime in areas with capital punishment, I feel that it's pretty clear evidence that capital punishment does not help lower crime. It was a fairly unbiased survey. A follow-up survey supported the results.": 1,
          "I thought it was a little better at making its point because the study done with 14 states, instead of 10 (although I know ultimately the other researchers did 20). But altogether, a study with 14 is going to be more conclusive. However, this study, as well as the other one just isn't really that convincing because they don't really have any hardcore, or significant evidence, it's all kind of even and inconclusive.": 1,
          "As in the first study, it's obviosu they are for it considering they went to such lengths to prove how well a death penalty deters people from murdering.": 1,
          "too many variables that weren't considered.  ": 1,
          "Its basically the same as the previous study. The results were found inconclusive so it didn't really support either side of the argument. ": 1,
          "I believe that the critique was correct in the sense that the researchers 'cherry-picked' the states to use in the study.  I think a fair selection of states would heed new and different results.": 1,
          "This is an appallingly bad study. Most violent criminals are not especially civic-minded, and would likely neither know of or care about the recent establishment of capital punishment in the state or states they happened to be committing acts of mayhem that particular week. At very least, it would take several high profile executions over several years to bang into their heads that a possible legal consequence to their criminal acts might be their eventual state-sanctioned death. /  / One year is a ridiculously short time period to measure results.": 1,
          "I think it clearly shows that there is no deterrent effect. This study seems more well reasoned than the last. ": 1,
          "The proof is in the results.  States the had the death penalty had higher murder rates, compared to the states without the death penalty.  And the states were neighboring each other so it's not like they were comparing states from two different regions.  ": 1,
          "it was done alot better but things change did they take into account overall crime rate": 1,
          "Just as it was mentioned in some previous questions, crime rates in general dropped around the time the law was enacted. This also led me to think that there are too many variables that could prevent a valid conclusion.": 1,
          "I really didn't get a feel that they took either position. It was well balanced and offered statistics that support either belief but it is up to each individual to decide how they feel. Not just based on the possible deterrance but the fact that many who were on death row have been released after further information has been received. ": 1,
          "did not support the argument because things like murder rates won't drop that quickly. they should've done 5 years like the first study": 1,
          "Once again this study did not include major control factor such as major cities, and average crime rates per capita.": 1,
          "Well, I was informed before reading about the study that the researchers were opposed to capital punishment.": 1,
          "This study (as described here, at least) seems much more careful in isolating related and unrelated factors in the outcome. Looking only at states which had capital punishment for a number of years, and had actually carried out executions, for example, would help to ensure that we are seeing true effects of capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "The study seemed like nonsense to me - I find it very hard to believe that you can find 20 pairs of neighboring states and control for differences in crime rates, urbanization, etc. I think there are intangible things that just can't be accounted for. Also, there is a logical flaw in their hypothesis - what if states enacted capital punishment BECAUSE the murder rates were so high to begin with? I don't think their study can separate those two possibilities.": 1,
          "I thought that just by looking at the study alone, you woule think that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. However, you would need to take into account all of the other factors going on.": 1,
          "It slightly did not support the argument.  I think the time span of only a few years is not really long enough to truly support the results as the increase in murder could have been caused by other factors.": 1,
          "It seemed to show an even split, even with different states. The researchers could not determine one way or another.": 1,
          "This showed that capital punishment is not a deterrent by considering factors such as population and whether the states actually utilized capital punishment and still showed that it does not deter murders.": 1,
          "I believe this study supported capital punishment because they used neighboring states to conduct the study and found that the capital punishment was still effective. They even tried it with ten different neighboring states and still got the same results.": 1,
          "The stats are clear in showing that the murder rate is lower in states with capital punishment.": 1,
          "EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE.": 1,
          "I believe the researchers used more data points than the last and thus resulting in the conclusion that has been determined for a while. The capital punishment doesn't deter murders. If any thing like the study briefly discussed it my actually cause murder rates to climb. I think study did a better job, and if we look at the numbers capital punishment my not actual deter murders, and actually cost the tax payers more money.": 1,
          "The study's numbers were fairly even and inconclusive. ": 1,
          "there was nothing conclusive.  so it had no effect when looking at sets of neighboring states w/differing capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "Since there were four states on each side of this study and two that were even, no conclusion can be determined about whether capital punishment is a deterrent to murder or not.": 1,
          "THIS IS A LOT BETTER STUDY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE.  COMPARING URBAN POPULATION AND SIMILARITIES IN THE BORDERING STATES THAT HAVE OPPOSITE VIEWS ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IS ACUTALLY A VALID ONE.  AFTER RECIEVEING THE CRITISICM ABOUT COMPARING DIFFERENT STATES THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME AND SHOWED A FAVORITISM TOWARDS THE USE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMWENT.": 1,

          "I'm still a little skeptical because of the other factors that could've affected the results and that there wasn't really a control group in the study to show how crime fluctuated in another state with similar parole procedure changes. ": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. It showed that the data was basically equal, demonstrating that the passing or reinstating of capital punishment had no significant effect as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "It did a much better job in supporting capital punishment because it looked at a broader range of time and also compared it with similar states.": 1,
          "The study didn't show anything conclusive.": 1,
          "The study supported capital punishment because it showed lower murder rates in 8 of 10 states that had the death penalty.  ": 1,
          "The evidence strongly supported the claim that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The researchers concluded that capital punishment does not deter murder. The crime rate being higher the year before and after the adoption of capital punishment is their evidence. What they fail to explain is the states that did have a lower murder rate after the capital punishment laws were adopted. Neglecting data to prove a point is very reckless.": 1,
          "The study seems to show a slight lean towards result that the death penalty is not a deterrent ": 1,

          "The study neither supported nor unsupported the reasoning that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, though it may have proven that people aren't really worried about the punishment whenever they're committing such crimes. Capital punishment is seen by many as a recompense for those suffered, not as a deterrent.": 1,
          "It supported the argument because it only showed data that had lowered crime or stayed the same. It seems pretty strange that there were no cases of heightened crime.": 1,
          "The study showed that it didn't make a difference if the state had capital punishment - some murder rates went up and some went down. One third stayed the same.": 1,
          "Because the murder rates in most of the states were lower a year after the death penalty was instituted.": 1,
          "I think the study did not support the thesis that capital punishment is a deterrent for murder because it actually showed evidence that it may have the opposite effect.": 1,
          "I think check about two states that are neighboring is not a good indicator for see if the capital punishments works or not, because there are states that are neightboring one to each other and one has a very crime index and the other doesn't have that.": 1,
          "The statistics did not support that train of thought at all.": 1,

          "The study did not take into consideration how the murder rate increased in states without the death penalty. It is possible that the murder rates increased even higher there.": 1,
          "For capital punishment since they showed that states that had capital punishment had lower murder rates. ": 1,
          "A skewed result": 1,
          "I believe that capital punishment will help lower down criminal offenses.": 1,
          "This study was a simple one, studying the murder rates in states that implemented a death penalty in the year prior to the law and the year following the law.  I didn't find the data convincing for the same reasons as the previous example - there's a huge difference in murder rates from state to state, the murder rate was only reported to two significant digits (and the difference was only by 1 in the last significant digit in several cases.)  My main question was what is the typical variability in murder rates in these states year over year?   If the authors had that data, and the murder rate drop was statistically significant in more or more states, that would be a quick rejoinder to the critics, which was not apparently made.": 1,
          "I felt that the researchers were careful in their state selection for the data. Those who critiqued it may not have known that they went to such lengths to make sure there wasn't a bias in the results. ": 1,
          "It seems logical that the murder rate would go down at some point after the adoption of capital punishment that would show the deterrent effect of the punishment.  But it never seems to happen.  There appears to be no deterrent on murder. ": 1,
          "The results were inconclusive, so it does not seem to necessarily support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. ": 1,
          "By comparing rates within states, they eliminated many possible variables. While it's still not hard evidence, it is convincing.": 1,
          "This seemed biased.": 1,
          "I think this study did a better job of being more convincing since it used more states. I would still prefer all states be compared.": 1,
          "The initial stastics do show that capital punishmentis a deterrent, but what the critiques say about parole factors as well as the general percentage of crime kind of discredit the findings.  ": 1,
          "The data may be sensitive to the time window they chose for their analysis.": 1,
          "There are numerous reasons why murder rates could vary in bordering states, and some states are widely different from one part to the next, i.e. east Texas probably doesnt have that much in common with New Mexico.": 1,
          "I just think it was unbiased": 1,
          "The study was very inconclusive, in fact the results were completely random. ": 1,
          "Comparing states with and without capital punishment gave more credit to the study, in my opinion. ": 1,
          "The total rate lowered is more than the rate highered.": 1,
          "Based on the way that the study is worded, I believe they are for the death penalty. It supported the arguments based on the decrease in crime in all of those states.": 1,
          "It seemed to extol the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "I think it did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the year before the death penalty was started, the murder rates were lower than the year after it was started. I don't think it was a long enough study though. It should have looked for years before and years after and taken more factors into consideration.": 1,
          "the study did support the argument, because the murder rate is lower after the capital punishment is established": 1,
          "Again, clearly other factors are in play. The study was done well. But the hypothesis was inconclusive. What needs to be studied is whether the threat of capital punishment leads more people to plead guilty to a lesser offense in order to avoid the death penalty.": 1,
          "It showed that the murder rate rose in those states that adopted the death penalty.": 1,
          "Again, they stated multiple times that the crime rate in states with capital punishment should be lower and it wasn't.": 1,
          "because the crime rate reduced.": 1,
          "I think that this study did support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because they used a very large data pool.  They attempted to make the states be as alike as they could by trying to match city size, urban area, etc.  They also repeated the study using different neighboring states with almost the same results.  Everything was well documented and their counter argument was backed up by hard data. ": 1,
          "definitely supported with crappy info": 1,
          "Again, I think a survey that takes more than two years into account would be more convincing. ": 1,

          "Again the study doesn't show  any positive of capital punishment. It shows that half the time it gets better and half the time it gets worse after implementation. The other surrounding issues sway the results and it ends up looking like capital punishment does nothing.  ": 1,
          "I have always been pro capital punishment.  11 out of 14 states murder rates dropped, that is significant.": 1,
          "It created a clear comparison as to how they were measuring the efficiency of capital punishment as a deterrent. They took into account any possible arguments and responded in kind. Their methodology was clear and understandable.": 1,
          "They don't really say that they are from either side. They also tried to validate their study by running it again.": 1,
          "They were suggesting that the rates were relatively unchanged in states with the capital punishment compared to those without. This is an argumentative standpoint in favor of opposing capital punishment's efficacy.": 1,
          "I think it might appear that way, but given that they didn't do anything to screen out other changes in the law that may have affected murder rates, and that crime in general was down, I don' think the minor variations in murder rates justify the belief that capital punishment alone is a deterrent. ": 1,
          "because they had brought up different things against the study": 1,
          "They seemed to be pushing the issue  heavily that if capital punishment was present murder rates were increased.": 1,
          "The murder rates in neighboring states was so close in some cases I wouldn't consider it a difference at all. The study seemed poorly constructed, and monitoring rates after states put capital punishment into place seems far more indicative of its efficacy. ": 1,
          "The researchers were pretty clear in their opinion of capital punishment. They flat out said it didn't work as a deterrent, and was ineffective in preventing crime. The critics' arguments implied that the researchers selectively manipulated the facts to fit their conclusions.": 1,
          "The side by side comparison of similar states is a good way to show whether you think the death penalty is convincing or not.  It shows that a large majority of the states sampled showed lower crime rate that a neighboring state that didn't have the death penalty.  Although it is hard to tell whether the death penalty was the reason for the decrease.": 1,
          "This did not convince me that the death penalty deters murder. Sure, most of the state pairs exhibited lower murder rates in the states with the death penalty, but the two pairs with the greatest difference between state murder rates exhibited a much higher murder rate in the state WITH the death penalty instated. The study also made no mention of confounding factors such as education and gun control in the chosen states. Choosing urbanization as the only factor linked to crime in oversimplistic and discriminatory.": 1,
          "It showed that in most cases the violent crime rate went up after instituting capital punishment thereby not supporting the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent. ": 1,
          "This study shows pretty evenly whether capital punishment is a deterrent to murder or not.": 1,
          "I agree with the critics of the study. When I looked at the numbers, many of the drops in rates were very small and could be attributed to other factors. Plus, the study should have looked at more than just the difference in one year, since crime rates could naturally fluctuate. ": 1,
          "For the same reason I listed in the other explanation. I feel that if the laws are questioned, there is some opinion that the laws should be changed and I do think the study favors striking capital punishment law from the books.": 1,
          "The study seems to indicate that the existence of capital punishment laws has no effect on murder rates in a given state. Obviously the possible criticisms that can be made should keep us from drawing too broad of a conclusion (for one thing, any speculation about a particular state with or without such a punishment is entirely counterfactual), but it does at least suggest that capital punishment *isn't* working as a deterrent overall. Of course this is hard to reconcile with the prior study, which suggests further studies need to be done examining whether one or both of them are based on faulty assumptions.": 1,
          "Many more variables were controlled for in this study, yet the results were the same. About the same number of murder rates increased ad decreased with capital punishment being instated. There is no common trend that capital punishment deters or increases murder rate.": 1,
          "It doesn't take into account other factors that may have influence the murder rate. ": 1,
          "It seemed that whether or not states had and used their death penalty laws had no real effect on murder rates in cities; murder rates didn't really differ between states with the death penalty and states without.": 1,
          "I think that it doesn't matter what type of penalty is given for murder.  The murderer doesn't care if she/he will be put to death.  They are going to commit the murder, no matter what the consequences are for them.": 1,
          "i fell like this study was trying to see how inconsistent these other studies are. ": 1,
          "This showed through a more thorough analysis that states with capital punishment when compared to similar states without typically had lower murder rates. Capital punishment may be a deterrent.": 1,
          "The facts were very clear but I think the study pretty much just clearly stated the facts rather than support a certain way, the study was put together and presented very well.": 1,
          "The study seemed inconclusive and poorly done. Since the results were inconclusive, I don't think it's fair to say that the results of the study supported capital punishment.": 1,
          "I didn't think that the numbers were that convincing in the Kroner study.": 1,
          "From the research shown here it seem that states with capital punishment generally had a lower rate in crimes/murders than the states bordering them without capital punishment. It seems that the research is with them and states with capital punishment generally have less crime/murders and I am for that.": 1,
          "This study showed that capital punishment does work as a deterent for murder. They showed that in neighboring states, one having the death penalty and the other state not, the murder rate was lower in states that have the death penalty.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument because it showed 8 out of 10 pairs of states having lower murder rates where there is no death penalty in that state.": 1,
          "It seems to have done the same as the first study, but with different data samples, using the same states across time, rather than across different states. Evidence gathered this way seems to point toward the death penalty change having a noticeable effect.": 1,
          "The results seem pretty inconclusive - if some states experienced increases, and others experienced decreases, it could be that capital punishment has no deterrent effect.": 1,
          "I think it looks like it is a deterrent, but I still think there could be another reason for their statistics.  Still, it is persuasive.  I just feel like there has to be a better way than to kill as punishment.  We just had a botched execution, and it makes you wonder.  (The Green Mile makes you wonder too.)  Perhaps economics or Internet information or lifestyle changes have more to do with the decrease in crime and it is just a consequence.  I do not see controls in this experiment, but I don't know how controls could be enacted with this type of experiment.  Perhaps they should ask criminals and the public whether capital punishment keeps them from wanting to do a crime.  ": 1,
          "This study is better since it is able to make better comparisons (since the pairs of states border each other). The group of statistics seems better thought-out and supports the theory better.": 1,
          "It's possible that the researchers ignored the decline in general crime rates because it would detract from their argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The results (5 with less murder per 100,000, 4 unchanged, 5 with more murder per 100,000) are roughly cancelled out and show no real answer.": 1,
          "States without capital punishment had higher rates of murder than neighboring states with the death penalty.": 1,
          "Again, the study shows no real support nor non support with these findings. They are basically equal either way. Or at least that is how I view it.": 1,
          "This shows that relatively similar states (in that they're located in the same general location) have different crime rates based on the presence of capital punishment. Since the crime rates are lower in states with capital punishment, the study would suggest it is the main factor responsible for the difference.": 1,
          "Although this isn't the best study because it is not quite comprehensive enough, and probably doesn't follow a large enough timespan, the basic stats seem to show that the adoption of the death penalty didn't seem to deter people from commiting homicide, as the murder rate often actually went up after adoption.": 1,
          "I think that the study leans more towards capitol punishment because it said the states with capitol punishment crime went down.": 1,
          "Because the murder rate after the adoption of capital punishment was higher.": 1,
          "It did not support capital punishment as a deterrent to murder, but I also felt that this study was biased toward that outcome.": 1,
          "It just seems like they're doing anything to make the study favor the death penalty. It just doesn't seem like an unbiased opinion.": 1,
          "The study I read about supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the study they did showed that 7 out of ten states had a lower murder rate after capital punishment was reinstated.": 1,
          "I thought this was relevant because it included the change in murder rates": 1,
          "I think the survey brought out good points that capital punhiment is not a deterent for crime. They also did a survey on another 10 states and the research material was the same.": 1,
          "The study seemed like it didn't take enough into consideration, focusing narrowly on its own interpretation of what makes capital punishment effective or not": 1,
          "they talked about how the states with it did notice an oppsite effect with higher rates ": 1,
          "The author of that study was probably neither against or for capital punishment.  Because he showed that 5 states that approved capital punishment, crimes went down, but another 5 states it was the opposite,  So, my prediction is that he was neutral.": 1,
          "It supported capital punishment from showing that murder rates were lower in states with capital punishment ": 1,
          "I think it shows that any change is coincidence and that a direct correlation can't be made any data can be skewed to make the arguement": 1,
          "The point that states that adopt capital punishment become more stricter is relevant and a very good point.": 1,
          "They were quoted as giving reasoning that if capital punishment actually worked then the murder rates would have decreased in certain states, but they did not. They replied to criticism by showing that while it may be effective in some states, in others it was not, so it was, at best, inconclusive as to if capital punishment actually worked.": 1,
          "These researchers showed that in the first study, in eight out of ten pairs of states the state that had the death penalty had lower rates of murder, and in a subsequent replication, seven out of ten states with the death penalty had lower rates of murder, signifying capital punishment might actually deter murder.": 1,
          "This is essentially the same as the previous one. Only part of the states were studied, not all. I understand that this was a study to see changes in the rates when a state recently adopted capital punishment but regardless, they only reviewed murder rates not overall crime rates. Was this done because murder is the only crime that will receive the death penalty? ": 1,
          "It showed the before and after effects of the death penalty": 1,
          "The results of the study were otherwise unclear (in my opinion) due to the fact that it yielded indeterminent results; the researches also generalized crime (lumping the murder rate in with other crimes) so as to see the overall effect of capital punishment on criminals. There were also several other factors that may have caused a different yield as opposed to just having capital punishment, including stricter or more lenient policies on parole, etc.": 1,
          "It showed all the numbers. I think it was unbiased.": 1,
          "Still biased towards one conclusion.": 1,
          "increase statistically insignificant": 1,
          "Again, this study showed no real benefit to Capitol punishment as a deterrant. If it is not effective it should not be used.": 1,
          "Maybe the study should try to cover every single state instead of just the ones that cover capital punishment. ": 1,
          "The study was really good.  It really showed how the adoption of capital punishment helped to reduce the murder rate across most states.": 1,
          "Overall the murder rate was higher so it would lead you to believe it has the opposite effect. ": 1,
          "I thought the study was interesting because it tried to match similar states to reduce cultural/urban differences.  Because the results were mixed, I don't believe capital punishment deters crime.": 1,
          "I thought this study did not support that capital puishment is a deterrent to murder as the date it present showed that 11 or fhe 14 states they looked at had a higher murder rate after the introduction of capital punishemnt. ": 1,
          "again, people dying for no real benefit to anyone": 1,
          "Again, it doesn't seem to make a difference in the murder rate when imposing this law, so why bother with it?": 1,
          "I think the group controlled their variables as best as they could. Controlling for population, urbanization, status of death penalty etc. is all very thorough and well thought out. Therefore their data is probably very accurate etc as well": 1,
          "Its clear from the data that murder rates are lower than the states that have capital punishment": 1,
          "The study showed that the murder rates were lower": 1,
          "It pretty much showed that it didn't matter either way, however because I believe the researchers were opposed to it from the beginning I have to question why not just show all 50 states and show if capital punishment is legal or not in each state. I believe overall that it is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "It supported capital punishment by choosing states which also changed the standards on parole as well as adding the death penalty. Therefore, there was additional incentive by criminals not to do capital crimes. The study was not balanced, therefore invalid.": 1,
          "states that implement the death penalty - will not have an execution for years due to appeals from inmates, the effect of the death penalty, i feel does not begin sink in to residents of those states until they actually begin to execute inmates - the survey needs to be done and compared over time , after the death penalties are actually carried out for some time from state to state": 1,
          "This one as well shows that in nearly all cases, capital punishment works as a deterrent.  With the exception of a couple states, the death penalty works.  Though this one is less convincing  it still shows in favor of capital punishment": 1,

          "This study was not in support to capital punishment. It's thought that cause some states went up it was not working.": 1,
          "I think they laid out the facts and you can't really argue with statistics.": 1,
          "It seemed to not support capital punishment as a deterrent. I feel it showed this somewhat that murder rates went up after a state enacted new capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "There doesn't seem to be any bias because they limited their factors. The fact that they looked into urbanization and etc when choosing their states makes me believe this study is more thought out than the other.": 1,
          "The study would help people arguing for capital punishment because it shows, even if only a little, that capital punishment does have an effect on crime rates.": 1,

          "Data was shown toward a bias toward capital punishment, but some results show that the correlation is inconclusive.  More factors are needed to show a correlation.": 1,
          "Perhaps I am just initially biased (I am opposed to the death penalty - except for violent psychopaths with no hope of rehabilitation), but even though this study was performed more effectively/thoughtfully than the previous example, I am still not nearly as swayed by the results (as I was by the first study). I do think that it demonstrated that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder (although it didn't convince me), since it took into account more variables (metropolitan size, similar populations since they're neighboring states) and tried to control for them. ": 1,
          "I did not support the claim. The study was flawed. Of course they cherry picked the states. Also this ignores other factors.  When these states both had the same type of punishment was the difference still there?  Also the statistical difference was very small. In fact the two cases which did not support their claim had the largest difference in crime rate.  The best thing to do is to compare one state to itself.  Too many other factors to simply decide that the death penalty was the difference.": 1,

I would want to see more data over time, did the rates continue to decline? Were the rates already on the decline.  One year prior and after are not enough data, plus there could have been other factors.  Perhaps more attempted murder victims survived, was there increased police prescence?

          "It showed very incomplete information.  A single year difference is not enough to see the effect of a law change.  Also, they qualitative answer of 11 out of 14 states having an increased crime rate after the law change doesn't show the increase in most of those was very small.": 1,

          "The new studies show that capital punishment does not produce the desired deterrence effect.": 1,
          "This study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder by presenting fairly substantial differences in the murder rates of two neighboring states with similar conditions, the main difference being the use of capital punishment. It was a more effective study than the last because they were able to replicate their results when presented with doubt, and they removed other factors very well that may have skewed the results.": 1,

A reader of the study would find the same amount of evidence supporting both sides. It would not help the reader decide on anything. It was completely neutral.": 1,
          "My original thought was that comparing neighboring states would produce very little of value, though after reading about the methodology and how things were set up, I have a little more faith in the researchers.  While still not a great endorsement of capital punishment, I don't feel this study was as flawed as the previous one.": 1,

Compare that to the national average, and then go back and look at when laws were enacted that deal with violent crime and see what effect those laws have. Don't simply concentrate on the death penalty. Again, we are left with too little information.\"": 1,

I think that way they will see that the murder rate will decrease soon after 1 year. ": 1,
          "I don't think it supported the argument it is a deterrent.  If anything, it just shows the death penalty does nothing.  In the sampled states, there was basically no noticeable difference between murder rates, with some states being higher and some states being lower.  I would think if the death penalty had a deterrence there would be a clear pattern that states with the death penalty had fewer murders than their neighbors. ": 1,

          "The data do not support the idea that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the study concluded that the implementation of capital punishment did not have a conclusive effect on the murder rate.  As a result, we can not say that capital punishment does or does not result in decreased murder rates.": 1,
          "The whole study was inconclusive so it didn't provide evidence for or against capital punishment.": 1,
          "again, most of the states they found had a strong coorelation between murder rates vs capitol punishment. The researchers attempted to find this and succeeded, proving in this study the threat of capitol punishment deters crime.": 1,

          "the research results clearly showed the death penalty wasn't a deterrent to murder": 1,
          "It seems that those behind this study were already strongly opposed to capital punishment, and sought a way of presenting data that would give credibility to their beliefs.  The data appears to make the very questionable claim that capital punishment laws actually cause more murder in states that have them.": 1,

          "i think the study supported the argument against capital punishment convincingly. In response to the critics Palmer and Crandall duplicated the results with another set of states which made it even more convincing. i suppose I'm just a bit sceptic of the whole argument being as simplistic as capital punishment having much of an effect one way or another.": 1,

Unless it's far more aggressive the death penalty won't change any minds and even then it's highly unlikely it was change much.  Save the taxpayers money and just get it over with.  I could be much more specific on my views but it's a long and drawn out reasoning based on admiting the deed in court during the trial and how that should speed it up even more.": 1,

          "This study, to me, clearly demonstrated that capital punishment does not act as a deterrent, since the murder rates were lower in all but two capital punishment states.": 1,
          "At the beginning it stated they opposed it.": 1,
          "I DO NOT THINK THE SECOND STUDY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DONE AS CAREFULLY AS THE FIRST. there did not seem to be much, if any big difference in murder rates.  / Besides, all that really does not matter since there have been so many cases where innocent people have been convicted of murder and some sentenced to death.": 1,
          "I think this study did nothing to prove that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the results balanced out and were inconclusive. ": 1,
          "There are many other factors for why the crime rate is lower in those states than the ones that border them.": 1,
          "Did not support the argument because 3 out of the 10 state pairs increased. Other factors include mental instability or imbalances of the criminals. Capital punishment is of no effect if the criminal can't comprehend it psychologically.": 1,
          "They pointed out fairly convincingly that there were more than 50% of the instances when murder stayed the same or got worse. This doesn't show a positive coorilation to the support of capital punishment.": 1,
          "This study seems to paint a much clearer picture. There are still numerous variables to account for, but the study does a good job of eliminating some of the biggest variables that could skew the results. However, it would be more convincing to see a longer spread of time rather than just two years. Five years before and after would be better.": 1,
          "I think that this study makes it appear like capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, but I would not consider it to be proof.  If the Kroner and Phillips 2012 study is real, it only looked at one year before and after the adoption of the law.  It's possible that a change in the law causes short term effects that don't last after people get used to the law.  If a state which formerly did not have the death penalty now suddenly does, people will be thinking about capital punishment a lot more than ten years of the death penalty existing.  People will be less used to the death penalty, more afraid of it, and likely would believe it would be used a lot more often and easily than what actually ends up happening.  Once the law is old news, people may go back to their previous behavior.  Also, if people know that right now there is no capital punishment, but there will be or may be next year, that might make them more likely to murder, in order to get it done before they can be killed for it.  So I would guess it's also possible that the year immediately before the adoption of the death penalty might have more murders than previous years.  It is even possible that the year before the change in law could be farther from the average than the year after the change in the law.  I think this study would be more meaningful if they looked at ten or twenty years before and after the change in the law.  Also, even in this study I think the differences in the murder rate were small.  Even though they were generally all in one direction, they were still very small differences.": 1,
          "Like the first study, this study did not support the argument because there was no significant data collected to show that capital punishment has any affect on the murder rate. ": 1,
          "Researchers compared states with common borders that did and did not have capital punishment, and those that had capital punishment had higher murder rates.": 1,
          "As I said before, correlation does not imply causation.": 1,
          "The study claims that capital punishment is a deterrent because they chose neighboring states that both have and don't have capital punishment laws. The states that do have the laws showed a lower murder rate.": 1,
          "The researchers study the murder rate in a number of states across a two year span.  In the first year the states did not have capital punishment, in the second year, the states did have capital punishment.  They found that in a majority of the states, the murder rate dropped.  Based off this, they concluded that capital punishment would deter murder.": 1,
          "The study was inconclusive, which in and of itself implies that captital punishment does not strongly deter people from murdering others (if it did, we would have seen some trend in their data).  Thus, it implies that, at best, capital punishment only very weakly deters murder.": 1,
          "I agree with the critics that say that different sets of state pairs would yield different results. I have no way to prove this thought but that's what I think. This study seems more convoluted than the first study.": 1,
          "This study seemed less bias. It used a bigger sampling data and there were states where crome wasn't lower.": 1,
          "The study showed the difference in murder rate between the year before capital punishment was instated and the year after. In almost all cases, the murder rate was lower once capital punishment was put into affect.": 1,

          "I do not think that I agree what this study reports, that capitol punishment is a determent to murder. I think their statistics were skewed to meet their agenda and not technically correct.": 1,
          "This study shows how scatter-shot the results of the death penalty is. I feel that it wasn't intended to prop either side of the argument up, since they actually showed their mixed results (twice, counting when they used ten other states).": 1,
          "In this study it shows that states that adopted the death penalty saw increases in murder, overall and  on average.  I would've like to have seen statistics for all crime such as theft, assault, or rape included to make this study more thorough.  As for murder though, this study adds credibility to the idea that the death penalty does zilch to deter it.  I'd list why that is but I already compiled that in a previous text box concerning the Palmer and Crandall (2012) study.  Furthermore, is it ever morally justifiable to kill?  Is it morally justifiable to give one group a monopoly on killing (government / justice system)?  Does this not mean everyone is complicit in murder if they are apart of the society that is involved in murdering those under the death penalty.  These studies do little to sway or re-enforce my opinion on capital punishment.  Moral arguments have already done so. It doesn't work, nor is it ever right to kill someone unless in cases of self-defense. It certainly doesn't solve the problem of crime or murder, those are societal issues and possibly educational issues that we need to address as a country / community.": 1,
          "There's so many flaws with the basic premise to this study.  What do neighboring states have to do with anything?  Is the thought that murders will travel out of state to kill someone, and flock to closer, more lenient states?  That's not even addressing the fact brought up in the criticism that most states have multiple neighbors.  I'm sure you could do the inverse study where a state without the death penalty has a neighboring state that does have the death penalty, but with a higher murder rate.": 1,
          "The study presented numbers showing that states with the death penalty had higher murder rates.": 1,
          "The study didn't suppor the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. It showed that after states implemented capital punishment murder rates stayed about the same. ": 1,
          "The fact that they compared two states next to each other and then were able to compare the capital punishment states to other states and still have the same result completely proves to me that the study was correct.": 1,
          "If the murder rate increased after capital punishment was instituted in the majority of the states studied, then anyone who is not biased would see that capital punishment does nothing to hinder a murderer from killing.": 1,
          "Once again, I still feel that capital punishment is needed. I feel that these rates aren't based on the fact that each of these states have capital punishment or just recently adopted it. Crime rates rise! It's just a fact of life.": 1,
          "I don't think it supported it based off of their arguments they made.": 1,
          "It seems that all studies conducted on this matter always come up the same. After the implementation/ reinstatement of the death penalty the rate of murders went down. Some critics are just out their to push there beliefs on others because they want to feel special in some way.": 1,

          "The authors concluded that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, but I'm not fully convinced that the research properly supports that argument.  They used neighboring states and controlled for urbanization, but I don't know if and how they controlled for other contributing factors that affect the murder rate.  They also only compared each pair of states for the year 2012, but not other years.  It's possible that for other years, the trend they observed is the opposite.": 1,

          "Not enough data points.  No data regarding to whom capital punishment was applied.  Study still shows that in some states capital punishment laws increased the murder rate.": 1,
          "In this case it did seem that the researchers did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  They discussed how states with the death penalty had higher averages of murder.": 1,
          "I feel this an incomplete argument, not considering lots of other aspects of the arguments.": 1,
          "The fact that this study was based on one year of results makes it completely unconvincing. Even if the conclusions are completely correct, one year of results says nothing. Perhaps there is a short term reduction in murder rates but over time the rates return to normal? Not even considering yearly fluctuations or other changes as suggested by critics, one single year compared to another doesn't say anything to convince me. My personal opinion is that the death penalty doesn't deter or promote crime so I realize that I've just voiced strong disagreement with two pro-capital punishment studies but I do not consider myself particularly biased - there is nothing here that convinces me. This is akin to anecdotal evidence - at least the other study had an excuse for a small sample size, there are only so many states to draw from much less those that fit the criteria. In this case it's inexcusable to have chosen one single year and say it is indicative of anything.": 1,
          "Same issue as the last one, study is too narrow in scope to draw conclusions about the overall issue from the data.": 1,
          "I think that, with the follow-up study, it becomes moderately strong evidence. Repetition is key in having strong data.  While the urban per capita is an important factor to take into account, social issues are extremely complex, and there could be other factors at work as well. As with the previous study, the differences between the 2 states is not that great, and it is not indicated whether it is statistically significant.": 1,
          "Because their results showed no correlation between the two finding capital punishment irrelevant": 1,
          "This study seems more reasonable to me, though the sample size, as the critics pointed out was rather small. I think the fact that the study was replicated with different states and ended roughly with the same results, lends some validation.  It doesn't support or oppose capital punishment one way or the orther as a deterrent. It said it was inconclusive. ": 1,
          "This study seems more causal - it compares murder rates before and after.  Thus, it seems pretty compelling.  I'm not sure of the interpretation, though. I'm not convinced that having a death penalty will change the perceptions of a culture to be more violent in just a year.  /  / I'm still not sure that the differences are meaningful.  It looked like that the rates were really similar or in the opposite direction for the majority of states (thus, the effect could have been driven by just a few).  It would be more helpful to look at the rates for a period greater than a year (to ensure that people know the law, and that the effect isn't driven by a change itself.": 1,

          "Unfortunately, the whole situation in which the study is performed is dependent on the idea that people are rational a large amount of the time, and that as they are about to commit crimes pull out the blue book to see what the possible penalties that they may face for that crime. I don't believe that people are that rational. / The study might be presented as evidence for the idea that a capital punishment law increases the murder rate, but I don't believe that rational people would back that. / Again, I don't base my position on capital punishment on whether one person dying will keep others from commiting the same crime. It is about the person who commited the crime, NOT future criminals.": 1,

When I looked over the data, the murder rates before and after the adoption of capital punishment in surveyed states is extremely close.

          "The study was not particularly conclusive at all. A virtually equal number of states fell into one of the three categories (increased murders, decreased murders, no change in murders). It's difficult to draw any meaningful conclusion except that the either hypothesis (that capital punishment increases/decreases murder rates) wasn't proved. Nothing was disproved.": 1,
          "I think an interesting point was made in the fact that they only really studied the murder rate.  While capital punishment may have little affect on murder rates, I suppose it could impact other forms of crime.": 1,

It does support the argument that capitol punishment is a deterrent for committing a crime.  The study would not likely change a person who is against capitol punishment on moral or religious grounds though.": 1,

          "In this study, the numbers were too close to call. The rates were such small percents. This study should have been conducted after many years of having the death penalty in place. ": 1,
          "If capital punishment were a deterrent to murder, the states that permit capital punishment would have lower crime rates.  However, the opposite was true.": 1,
          "The study showed that when states institute the death penalty, murder rates don't decrease.  It's unclear if they increase or not, given the limitations of the study, but the evidence doesn't support a deterrent effect.": 1,
          "Seems like capital punishment isn't a deterrent.": 1,
          "I think this study was not as clear cut as the first but I still think they oppose the death penalty.  I think in this study they meay have been biased because it does not seem like they took all the different variables in consideration.": 1,
          "I think it was completely inconclusive.  Shown by similar results using 10 different states": 1,
          "The study appeared to indicate that murder rates actually increased in states that adopted the death penalty.": 1,
          "they support capital punishment  because they said the murder rate should be lower in the states  with capital punishment ": 1,
          "It showed that states that adopted capital punishment did not have a lower murder rate than the year before when there was no capital punishment.  Though this could be attributed to people who are stupid enough to commit murders probably don't keep up on current capital punishment law.s": 1,
          "The facts show again, 5 states have better murder rates, and 5 have worse.": 1,
          "I think that the current study tries to move people towards opposing capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. They provide a larger sample size which makes it a little more credible than the others, but the criticism provided against it also is fair. However, it is important to note that both studies provide their own inconsistencies. I think that this study is in opposition towards capital punishment though.": 1,
          "THey released a study showing after capital punishment was introduced it lowered the murder rate": 1,
          "I thought that the evidence shows no exact effect of capital punishment.  Because some states the rate lowered and in other states the crime rate grew.  So therefore with the even results one can not determine if Capital punishment is working.": 1,
          "This study looks too closely at the addition of the death penalty by just looking at the following year it was instated.  There is not enough time for the dust to settle as one may say.  The first study looked at states that actually have used the death penalty, and that is a much bigger message to criminals than 'we now have it'.  We all can name states that have the death penalty, like new york, and will probably never use it.  Criminals, as dumb as they are, know this.  I also wonder why these states added the death penalty, was crime already on the rise?  This stat could be at the top as the state was reactionaryto an upward trend leading to those numbers, and maybe given more time it will drop.  The first study just seemed more complete and more accurate over time. ": 1,
          "This study compared neighboring states, and states that had the death penatly typically had higher murder rates.  I think it is a poor study because how do you know which states to compare?  ": 1,
          "11 out of the 14 states in the study had an increased murder rate after adopting capital punishment.": 1,
          "I think it was clear that it supported neither stance because they redid the study with ten different pairs and got the same unclear data - there may or may not be a correlation. ": 1,
          "It seems to me that the person doing this study is trying to just give the facts and not take sides. ": 1,
          "I thought the study was correct in its conclusion of ambiguity -- the results don't seem to skew one way or the other, either for or against capital punishment, although one could argue that that in itself is an argument towards capital punishment as NOT a deterrent.": 1,
          "Again, there simply was no indication of a bias present in the researcher's statements nor their study or findings.": 1,
          "The study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  The study only focused on the murder rate being higher in neighboring states that do not have the death penalty.  However, it is biased in that does not look at how much the murder rate increased/decreased in the states with capital punishment laws after the laws were actually passed.": 1,
          "Either these are poorly premised studies or they are poorly described here.  2 data points for this one,  and still doesn't show any kind of long term trend,  also discounts other factors that could affect data.  The study shows no convincing evidence to support it's conclusions": 1,
          "The study shows that after the death penalty was implemented the murder rates went down.": 1,
          "This shows that adopting the death penalty can cause the number of death to decrease per year. ": 1,
          "The study does and does not support the death penalty. It has research for both the opposition and the favorable to the death penalty.": 1,
          "The data suggested that capital punishment deters murder.": 1,
          "This study showed that capital punishment actually lead to higher murder rates, so it is probably against the death penalty. ": 1,
          "I feel as though the study was a more effective way of determining whether or not capital punishment is effective. Although it would take some time to really show if the change was caused by the adoption of capital punishment. ": 1,
          "I think this was a much better test, although I don't think there is a positive answer to this question with any amount of testing.  I think the general makeup of the state provides a much better comparison and feel confident based on what was presented in this study, that capital punishment doesn't mead to more murders and it might even deter it.": 1,
          "It showed that the murder rates actually raise, and, thus, it is not a deterrant. ": 1,
          "They designed their study to study the effects of the death penalty in order to get results that would favor one side": 1,
          "I guess that depends on how you define deterrent. If you think deterring something would lead to less of that thing, then the study does not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "It showed that murder rates increased in 11 out of 14 states.": 1,
          "That fact to me is that no matter what you try to do murder will always exist but, the same murderer doesn't have to. There for I think Capital Punishment still deterrents murder by reducing the amount of people one murder can kill. ": 1,
          "The states that were looked at in both the study and the researchers' response to their critics were carefully chosen, which, as the previous study showed, might not be an accurate representation of the reenstatement of the death penalty itself but other, regional or cultural factors.": 1,
          "The study seemed to cherry pick data in order to support a theory. A more broad study may have came to a different result.": 1,
          "I think it did because they were citing a popular study.": 1,
          "The researchers themselves opposed capital punishment, and I think they may have manipulated the data in order to get the results they needed. I have no experience with scientific research, but I think that unbiased research is of utmost importance. This study shows that capital punishment alone clearly does not reduce violent crime rates. The results point that introducing capital punishment does not deter violent crimes, but just the opposite - they are on the rise. ": 1,
          "The study did not support capital punishment, as it claimed that within the year of capital punishment being implemented, the murder rates were actually higher. They claim that capital punishment does not deter potential murders.": 1,
          "It speaks to the variables I was concerned over. I think this eliminates some of the variables and creates new ones as well. Although it seems inconclusive and until there is some really conclusive information I remain unchanged on how I view this topic. ": 1,
          "Because as the study showed after states adopted capital punishment their murder rate fell over the previous years. ": 1,
          "There are too many factors that could have affected the murder rate besides the adoption of the death penalty. The test is too small to get a real idea if it was the death penalty that caused the change.": 1,
          "The study was flawed and complicated. ": 1,
          "The study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, because it demonstrated that murder rates in a sample group of states decreased after those states instituted the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think again, it seems clear that by showing that murder rates went up as a result of allowing the death penalty, that it does not have a deterrent effect. Sure, there could be other factors at play, but I think this is solid evidence.": 1,
          "In the sense they are trying to prove crime had gone up before and after the laws changed  I think they are opposed to the death penalty": 1,
          "I don't think in the end it did either because it was inconclusive. There were some states were it lowered the murder rate and some states it stayed the same, in other states the murder rate dropped. ": 1,
          "The study showed that capital punishment may not be a deterrent because it compared states with capital punishment and without": 1,
          "It didn't support any viewpoint as their data was all over the board. There was no clear indication. However, their data seems to indicate a missing vector. The knowledge of the people in those states in which capital punishment was either passed or used. If citizens of the state in question ambivalent to whether or not the law was either in effect or in use then that may have some bearing on the data collected.": 1,
          "i think they are trying to study these situations": 1,
          "Like in the previous study, the available pool of states to sample seems very small and very hard to judge any results one way or the other. The murder rate also seems like a statistic that would be prone to large shifts year to year, regardless of any policy changes, as well as one that might need to be looked at in a much lengthier segment of time than a year to year shift in order to account for the fluctuations in order to see if there is any sort of trend. Even if the data had indicated more for or against the argument I don't think the study can be used to support or not support the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "In two different sets of states, the state with the capital punishment law had a higher murder rate than the state without. ": 1,
          "It didn't really show conclusively either way.": 1,
          "The original study and its independent replication both had mixed outcomes.": 1,
          "The results of this study were inconclusive.  It is not possible to show that the study showed results favoring one way or the other because part of the states showed one way and the parts showed favor to the other way.": 1,
          "The use of comparison between two states with opposing laws on capital punishment provided some evidence that capital punishment does not deter someone from murder. ": 1,
          "The numbers that they showed still negatively impacted views toward favoring capital punishment. ": 1,
          "As in the last study this one did not go in depth on other factors, and the time period was far to small to draw any meaningfull conclusions.  I don't even have enough information to tell if they are cherry picking the results that support the conclusion they want.": 1,
          "The results were inconclusive. This speaks for itself. Correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, even if the majority of the states showed a decrease in crime following the implementation of the capital punishment laws, one could not say with certainty it was because of the laws. There could be a variety of things that could impact a state's crime rate. For example, if the economy improves, people have more money and less people will be forced to commit crime for various reasons. This is why that I feel the study neither supported nor opposed the argument. ": 1,
          "Like I said earlier in this survey, data can be manipulated brilliantly in statistics ti suit a premise. I stand by what I wrote earlier.": 1,
          "I believe that Capital punishment was shown to not work quickly at reducing the murder rate as shown in this study.": 1,
          "Because the research concluded that in 11 of the 14 states they studied that adopted capital punishment laws, the murder rate was lower than before the adoption of capital punishment laws": 1,
          "The study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent for murders because it was able to replicate its results in another study. The methodology seemed to be sound, as well.": 1,
          "I thought the study was flawed as well, however, just based in the murder rates alone, more states were unaffected or adversely affected after they adopted the death penalty, leadinge to conclude that the death penalty is not going to deter murder": 1,
          "I feel like they supported the idea of capital punishment because of the loser murder rates not just in the town that they were studying in, but the borders that they were also looking at, this combined together show that capital punishment works at least in theory in their study. They proved their point in their study rather well even by going back and getting other pairs and looking at them as well.": 1,
          "I think that the study does support the argument for capital punishment. It still shows that there was a drop in states that had capital punishment laws. ": 1,
          "These stats seem to show the opposite outcome as the last study.  It seems like the stats can be made to support either side of the argument.": 1

          "Again the study doesn't show  any positive of capital punishment. It shows that half the time it gets better and half the time it gets worse after implementation. The other surrounding issues sway the results and it ends up looking like capital punishment does nothing.  ": 1,
          "Again the study showed that even when adopted capital punishment may not be the best way to deter people from committing murders ": 1,
          "Again this was a bigger sample rate but it only proved that it really didn't matter if capitol punishment was effective in preventing crime.  I think the bigger issue is concerning whether it's moral to kill an inmate or not regardless of the effect on crime.": 1,
          "Again, clearly other factors are in play. The study was done well. But the hypothesis was inconclusive. What needs to be studied is whether the threat of capital punishment leads more people to plead guilty to a lesser offense in order to avoid the death penalty.": 1,
          "Again, even though the researchers in this case tried to control for every possibility, the results were the same with an equal number of states whose murders rates rose and fell and two whose rates were neutral.  This leaves the determination of the evidence that capital punishment deters crime is still inconclusive.": 1,

I bet many of the people commiting murder aren't the type to keep up with local news and may not have even known the death penalty was reinstated or enacted.  I would want to see more data over time, did the rates continue to decline? Were the rates already on the decline.  One year prior and after are not enough data, plus there could have been other factors.  Perhaps more attempted murder victims survived, was there increased police prescence? All of this would be additional info I'd need to determine if capital punishment was the tipping factor.  I am not convinced by what I read.": 1,

I could be much more specific on my views but it's a long and drawn out reasoning based on admiting the deed in court during the trial and how that should speed it up even more.": 1,

          "Although this isn't the best study because it is not quite comprehensive enough, and probably doesn't follow a large enough timespan, the basic stats seem to show that the adoption of the death penalty didn't seem to deter people from commiting homicide, as the murder rate often actually went up after adoption.": 1,

          "Capital punishment is tremendously expensive. Both over the short term (this study) and the longer term (the previous study) demonstrate that the presence of capital punishment in the arsenal of justice does not demonstrably impact murder rates in any way whatsoever.

          "EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE.": 1,
          "For capital punishment since they showed that states that had capital punishment had lower murder rates. ": 1,
          "For the same reason I listed in the other explanation. I feel that if the laws are questioned, there is some opinion that the laws should be changed and I do think the study favors striking capital punishment law from the books.": 1,
          "From the research shown here it seem that states with capital punishment generally had a lower rate in crimes/murders than the states bordering them without capital punishment. It seems that the research is with them and states with capital punishment generally have less crime/murders and I am for that.": 1,
          "From what i can tell if you average all of the data, it shows that their is really no difference between the states with and with out capital punishment. What i take away from this info is that in reality capital punishment is no real deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "granted the number of states that were lower was the same as the number of states that increased, however if you take the total difference amounts and add them up, the amount of less murders is significantly higher. Therefore because of the ability to scew statistics, I would say the were for capital punishment": 1,
          "Having it split so equally, with murder rates going down in 5 states and up in 5, I don't think this study provided enough proof to show that capital punishment was OR was not a deterrent to murder. ": 1,
          "I again feel that the data were inconsistent and the change small. I do,  however, feel like the latter study was better done.": 1,
          "I agree with the critics of the study. When I looked at the numbers, many of the drops in rates were very small and could be attributed to other factors. Plus, the study should have looked at more than just the difference in one year, since crime rates could naturally fluctuate. ": 1,
          "I agree with the critics that say that different sets of state pairs would yield different results. I have no way to prove this thought but that's what I think. This study seems more convoluted than the first study.": 1,
          "I am not certain the authors of the study were completely unbiased.  I would like to see all the factors involved that created the numbers they collected.  And how they came to their conclusions.  It could be that we have unevolved as a society and have gone so far down that criminals no longer care if they kill and if they are killed but my mind is not that jaded yet.": 1,
          "I believe it did not support the argument. Of course they tried comparison of states and tried to make it even by accounting for urbanization, but there are still other things that effect each state in a different way. With comparisons between bordering states, most states with capital punishment did show an increased rate of murder. But each state can not be treated as equal not to mention 10 test subjects cannot determine if something is true or not.": 1,
          "I believe it is not a fair representation of the effects of capital punishment on the murder rates.  Even neighboring states can be very different as far as culture and values go, so to compare two bordering states is pretty much comparing apples and oranges.": 1,
          "I believe it stated it was in favor of the capital punishment; however the data sets that he put out, both the original and the response to criticism, both showed that capital punishment did in fact reduce the murder rate in a majority of the states studied.": 1,
          "I believe it supports because the facts stated prove that capital punishment is effective. Through the data shown you can see that the murder rate went down.": 1,
          "I believe that Capital punishment was shown to not work quickly at reducing the murder rate as shown in this study.": 1,
          "I believe that capital punishment will help lower down criminal offenses.": 1,
          "I believe that it showed that lower rates in murders were a result of the reinstatement of capital punishment for many states, thus showing that it can be a deterrent for violent crime.": 1,
          "I believe that the critique was correct in the sense that the researchers 'cherry-picked' the states to use in the study.  I think a fair selection of states would heed new and different results.": 1,
          "I believe that the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it provided enough evidence to support my prior beliefs.": 1,
          "I believe that this study did not support that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it tried to argue that a state with capital punishment still has a higher percentage of murder compared to a neighboring state that has capital punishment.": 1,
          "I believe the researchers used more data points than the last and thus resulting in the conclusion that has been determined for a while. The capital punishment doesn't deter murders. If any thing like the study briefly discussed it my actually cause murder rates to climb. I think study did a better job, and if we look at the numbers capital punishment my not actual deter murders, and actually cost the tax payers more money.": 1,
          "I believe the study did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. Although I do believe critics of the study when they say multiple factors played a role in the changing murder rates in the states studied, if capital punishment was a true deterrent, then you would see a clear pattern of decreased murder rates in states that adopted it. That is not the case. ": 1,
          "i believe the study did not support the argument that captial punishment is a deterent to murder because the finding showed that even though the murder rate dropped in 5 of the 14 states studied, it either raised the rate or proved ineffective in the rest. ": 1,
          "I believe this study provided an argument that did not support the idea that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, however as I stated earlier this study is flawed as it does not look at all the possible variables that contribute to crime. ": 1,
          "I believe this study supported capital punishment because they used neighboring states to conduct the study and found that the capital punishment was still effective. They even tried it with ten different neighboring states and still got the same results.": 1,
          "I did not support the claim. The study was flawed. Of course they cherry picked the states. Also this ignores other factors.  When these states both had the same type of punishment was the difference still there?  Also the statistical difference was very small. In fact the two cases which did not support their claim had the largest difference in crime rate.  The best thing to do is to compare one state to itself.  Too many other factors to simply decide that the death penalty was the difference.": 1,
          "I didn't expect this side to be represented in the survey, but they did exactly what I was thinking as a way to test efficiency of the death penalty, to compare murder rates in the same areas before and after the law was established. / Yes I like this one more, as it confirms my opinion on the subject, and I like the way they tested it. it makes sense to me. / **to be fair, the same argument could be made for both. there are many factors involved, so this isn't necessarily 100% correct either. ": 1,
          "I didn't feel like the study was set out to prove a point. I got a \\\\here is some information that shows some decline, increase, and non change and decide for youself\\\\ vibe. It was really well done and gave the reader something to think about.": 1,
          "I didn't think that the numbers were that convincing in the Kroner study.": 1,
          "I do not think that I agree what this study reports, that capitol punishment is a determent to murder. I think their statistics were skewed to meet their agenda and not technically correct.": 1,
          "I do not think the numbers are conclusive either way.  Although the fact that there was a reduction in some of the states, I am not sure that conclusively determines the causation.  ": 1,
          "I DO NOT THINK THE SECOND STUDY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DONE AS CAREFULLY AS THE FIRST. there did not seem to be much, if any big difference in murder rates.  / Besides, all that really does not matter since there have been so many cases where innocent people have been convicted of murder and some sentenced to death.": 1,
          "I do not think the study conclusively argues for any one cause.": 1,
          "I do not think this study supports capital punishment because the study is flawed. Other factors could have been the cause for the lower murder rates. Correlation does not equal causation, therefore, this study has a big flaw. What this study did do was make me question if the other study committed the same fallacy. I overlooked that fallacy when I read the other study. It's a fallacy that can easily be missed. ": 1,
          "I don't believe it supported or did not support, since the results were almost totally inconclusive.": 1,
          "I don't know that the researchers can completely control for everything that differs between the bordering states. However because it appears that Capital Punishment states have higher murder rates it is against the deterrence argument.": 1,
          "I don't think in the end it did either because it was inconclusive. There were some states were it lowered the murder rate and some states it stayed the same, in other states the murder rate dropped. ": 1,
          "I don't think it actually supports capital punishment. Some of the states with the death penalty still had a higher murder rate. Most of the pairs weren't very far apart in their murder rate either. It wasn't different by an overwhelming amount, so it could still be other factors influencing the murder rates.": 1,
          "I don't think it supported it based off of their arguments they made.": 1,
          "I don't think it supported the argument it is a deterrent.  If anything, it just shows the death penalty does nothing.  In the sampled states, there was basically no noticeable difference between murder rates, with some states being higher and some states being lower.  I would think if the death penalty had a deterrence there would be a clear pattern that states with the death penalty had fewer murders than their neighbors. ": 1,
          "I don't think that it supported the argument very well. There's a lot more to consider than urbanization in two different states. There is so much context that could change crime rates. If three of the states were Souther/border states, for example, those states have more crime.": 1,
          "I don't think the results tracked over a single year are convincing; it is too hard to separate out capital punishment as the main cause of the change.  ": 1,
          "I don't think the studies given much evidence to either side of the debate. I suppose if you're strongly opposed or in favor you could use the data in the studies (cherry pick) to support your ideas on capital punishment.": 1,
          "I don't think the study did a very good job of supporting capital punishment as a deterrent to murder, because there are other factors that could have lowered the murder rate. Perhaps capital punishment and murder rates are correlated, but that does not mean the threat of capital punishment causes the murder rate to drop.": 1,
          "I don't think the study was done very well so I don't think an unbiased person would try to draw any conclusions from it. I think a year before and a year after isn't a long enough time period to use for this type of study, and I don't think the difference in the before year and after year in the states that saw an increase in murder rates was big enough to consider it significant.": 1,
          "I don't think this study favored either one.  The seemed to only look at the cause and affect of a law.": 1,
          "I don't think this study is very persuasive because nothing is controlled in the study.  In the first study we are talking about the same states before and after having the death penalty.  But in this study, we are looking at entirely different states.  One would expect states to differ in their crime rates for many reasons. /  / It's also possible that the states are self-selecting.  For example, there's more crime in big cities.  But big cities also vote Democratic so one would expect states with a large urban population to pass less conservative laws and maybe not have the death penalty.  That doesn't mean people are committing murders because of that law.": 1,
          "I don't think this study presented material that either supported or was against capital punishment. Rather,  I think it's somewhere in the middle. Since almost all of the states had small percentage changes either up or down, there's not really any conclusive evidence here.": 1,
          "i dont think they are in favor ": 1,
          "I feel as though the study was a more effective way of determining whether or not capital punishment is effective. Although it would take some time to really show if the change was caused by the adoption of capital punishment. ": 1,
          "I feel like it was less biasly worded, but yes, again it shows research that deters the possibility of capital punishment deterring murder rates.": 1,
          "I feel like the article was geared owards finding ways to punish criminals other than the death penalty": 1,
          "I feel like there could be many other factors at play. Just because the states shared borders doesn't mean that their other statistics would be similar. What about population? Urban population vs rural population? Gun laws? There would need to be a much larger sample size (longer period than one year) to have significant findings. ": 1,
          "I feel like they supported the idea of capital punishment because of the loser murder rates not just in the town that they were studying in, but the borders that they were also looking at, this combined together show that capital punishment works at least in theory in their study. They proved their point in their study rather well even by going back and getting other pairs and looking at them as well.": 1,
          "I feel this an incomplete argument, not considering lots of other aspects of the arguments.": 1,
          "i fell like this study was trying to see how inconsistent these other studies are. ": 1,
          "I felt it supported the argument for capital punishment but not as strongly as the first study. ": 1,
          "I felt that the researchers were careful in their state selection for the data. Those who critiqued it may not have known that they went to such lengths to make sure there wasn't a bias in the results. ": 1,
          "I guess that depends on how you define deterrent. If you think deterring something would lead to less of that thing, then the study does not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "i guess they are trying to determinate the impact and they are not in favor": 1,
          "i have a hard time judging these studies because i cannot be wavered on my opions of the death penalty and so i cannot reead it with out having an unbaist opinion on the matter": 1,
          "I have always been pro capital punishment.  11 out of 14 states murder rates dropped, that is significant.": 1,
          "I honestly thought the views in this research was rather unbiased. It didn't lean towards either side.": 1,
          "I just think it was unbiased": 1,
          "I notice one of the States is higher after capital punishment laws where approved and a lot of those got away with murderer. ": 1,
          "I really didn't get a feel that they took either position. It was well balanced and offered statistics that support either belief but it is up to each individual to decide how they feel. Not just based on the possible deterrance but the fact that many who were on death row have been released after further information has been received. ": 1,
          "I still want them to control for economic factors.  I like that they went five years out (did I read that right?) for use of DP. That's better.  But I still want data from more than 1 year.  How about five years of murder rates?  I don't know the literature that well, but it seems to me that to establish a trend you need more than a few months.    ": 1,
          "I tend to agree with the critics on this one, I think that there may have been other factors contribuiting to the reduction of homicides other than just the change in capital punishment laws. However, without really knowing which states they studied or anything I don't really know if that's true. ": 1,
          "I think again, it seems clear that by showing that murder rates went up as a result of allowing the death penalty, that it does not have a deterrent effect. Sure, there could be other factors at play, but I think this is solid evidence.": 1,
          "I think an interesting point was made in the fact that they only really studied the murder rate.  While capital punishment may have little affect on murder rates, I suppose it could impact other forms of crime.": 1,
          "I think check about two states that are neighboring is not a good indicator for see if the capital punishments works or not, because there are states that are neightboring one to each other and one has a very crime index and the other doesn't have that.": 1,
          "I think in this study, the researchers were looking to prove the argument of capital punishment would be a deterrent to murder but the statistics really didn't clearly show this. As many states had more crime after the installment of the death penalty, I found it to be unconvincing in this study.": 1,
          "I think it clearly shows that there is no deterrent effect. This study seems more well reasoned than the last. ": 1,
          "I think it did because they were citing a popular study.": 1,
          "I think it did not support but that the study was very flawed. A 2 year period of time is not enough to try and draw any correlation because a lot of factors were not considered.": 1,
          "I think it did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it is my strong opinion that during crimes of passion, which most murders are, no one stops to think they might get the death penalty if they kill a person. ": 1,
          "I think it did not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the year before the death penalty was started, the murder rates were lower than the year after it was started. I don't think it was a long enough study though. It should have looked for years before and years after and taken more factors into consideration.": 1,
          "I think it did support the arguement that capital punishment is a detterent to murder. It provided some statistics that clearly supported that. It showed how in the study conducted that the murder rate did go down, in not one, but two studies.": 1,
          "I think it looks like it is a deterrent, but I still think there could be another reason for their statistics.  Still, it is persuasive.  I just feel like there has to be a better way than to kill as punishment.  We just had a botched execution, and it makes you wonder.  (The Green Mile makes you wonder too.)  Perhaps economics or Internet information or lifestyle changes have more to do with the decrease in crime and it is just a consequence.  I do not see controls in this experiment, but I don't know how controls could be enacted with this type of experiment.  Perhaps they should ask criminals and the public whether capital punishment keeps them from wanting to do a crime.  ": 1,
          "I think it might appear that way, but given that they didn't do anything to screen out other changes in the law that may have affected murder rates, and that crime in general was down, I don' think the minor variations in murder rates justify the belief that capital punishment alone is a deterrent. ": 1,
          "I think it shows that any change is coincidence and that a direct correlation can't be made any data can be skewed to make the arguement": 1,
          "I think it slightly supports capitol punishment because the murder rates were less than a state didn't have it implemented.": 1,
          "I think it supported capital punishment and the results of their study seemed to make it appear so.": 1,
          "I think it supported the argument because it showed that 11/14 states had lower murder rates after adopting the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think it was a well conducted study and the fact that they results are inconclusive makes me feel that based on this study it should be up to the individual states to decide.": 1,
          "I think it was clear that it supported neither stance because they redid the study with ten different pairs and got the same unclear data - there may or may not be a correlation. ": 1,
          "I think it was completely inconclusive.  Shown by similar results using 10 different states": 1,
          "I think it was trying to show that it didn't matter if there was capital punishment because the murder rates were too inclusive.": 1,
          "I think part of the problem with the study is that I feel the states that have capital punishment could possibly be states with worse murder rates to begin with. If they were higher before hand, it stands to reason, they will most likely remain higher even with the capital punishment. ": 1,
          "I think that 11 out of 14 states decreasing in murder rate is significant in showing that capital punishment is a deterrent in murder rates. However, it could be do to other factors so I think a longer or bigger study needs to be done.": 1,
          "I think that it doesn't matter what type of penalty is given for murder.  The murderer doesn't care if she/he will be put to death.  They are going to commit the murder, no matter what the consequences are for them.": 1,
          "I think that the current study tries to move people towards opposing capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. They provide a larger sample size which makes it a little more credible than the others, but the criticism provided against it also is fair. However, it is important to note that both studies provide their own inconsistencies. I think that this study is in opposition towards capital punishment though.": 1,
          "I think that the study does support the argument for capital punishment. It still shows that there was a drop in states that had capital punishment laws. ": 1,
          "I think that the study leans more towards capitol punishment because it said the states with capitol punishment crime went down.": 1,
          "I think that the study negated the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it showed that murder rates were higher in states with capital punishment, and the survey was conducted two times. ": 1,
          "I think that this study definitely positioned the data to show against capitol punishment. They did not show the whole picture either. I think that most studies only present the data that favors their agenda.": 1,
          "I think that this study did support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because they used a very large data pool.  They attempted to make the states be as alike as they could by trying to match city size, urban area, etc.  They also repeated the study using different neighboring states with almost the same results.  Everything was well documented and their counter argument was backed up by hard data. ": 1,
          "I think that this study makes it appear like capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, but I would not consider it to be proof.  If the Kroner and Phillips 2012 study is real, it only looked at one year before and after the adoption of the law.  It's possible that a change in the law causes short term effects that don't last after people get used to the law.  If a state which formerly did not have the death penalty now suddenly does, people will be thinking about capital punishment a lot more than ten years of the death penalty existing.  People will be less used to the death penalty, more afraid of it, and likely would believe it would be used a lot more often and easily than what actually ends up happening.  Once the law is old news, people may go back to their previous behavior.  Also, if people know that right now there is no capital punishment, but there will be or may be next year, that might make them more likely to murder, in order to get it done before they can be killed for it.  So I would guess it's also possible that the year immediately before the adoption of the death penalty might have more murders than previous years.  It is even possible that the year before the change in law could be farther from the average than the year after the change in the law.  I think this study would be more meaningful if they looked at ten or twenty years before and after the change in the law.  Also, even in this study I think the differences in the murder rate were small.  Even though they were generally all in one direction, they were still very small differences.": 1,
          "I think that this supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent because it shows that through 2 different comparisons of neighboring states the murder rate was still lower for states with the death penalty": 1,
          "I think that, with the follow-up study, it becomes moderately strong evidence. Repetition is key in having strong data.  While the urban per capita is an important factor to take into account, social issues are extremely complex, and there could be other factors at work as well. As with the previous study, the differences between the 2 states is not that great, and it is not indicated whether it is statistically significant.": 1,
          "I think the article makes it sound like capital punishment doesn't work. I liked that more information was provided in this study. The results were neutral again, so I don't think it fully supports either view.": 1,
          "I think the author felt no specific way. His writings made it sound like he did not have vested interest in either. ": 1,
          "I think the group controlled their variables as best as they could. Controlling for population, urbanization, status of death penalty etc. is all very thorough and well thought out. Therefore their data is probably very accurate etc as well": 1,
          "I think the researchers were trying to show that capital punishment worked and in doing so, may have made it seem more favorable to that point than it really was.  A couple of the areas showed increases and the decreases were very slight.  As some of the critics said, there were also a lot of variables they didn't account for in making their argument. ": 1,
          "I think the statistics are enough to show some sort of advantage to not having capital punishment as it's not effective as a deterrent ": 1,
          "I think the stidy does not support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. Again, like the previous study, I don't know how any sensible person, after reading about this study, could come to the conclusion that capital punishment prevents murders from occurring. /  / If states that have the death penalty have higher murder rates than those that do not have the death penalty, (even when they share a common border) then obviously the death penalty doesn't work. /  / Again, I want to state that I may be biased here, since I do not support capital punishment. ": 1,
          "I think the study did not support the thesis that capital punishment is a deterrent for murder because it actually showed evidence that it may have the opposite effect.": 1,
          "I think the study did try to support the argument for capital punishment as a deterrent to murder. They stated that murder rates did respond to the states adopting capital punishment, and that crime in general dropped as well. ": 1,
          "i think the study is still inconclisive": 1,
          "I think the study needs further research. Numbers are too close to come to a conclusion.": 1,
          "i think the study supported the argument against capital punishment convincingly. In response to the critics Palmer and Crandall duplicated the results with another set of states which made it even more convincing. i suppose I'm just a bit sceptic of the whole argument being as simplistic as capital punishment having much of an effect one way or another.": 1,
          "I think the study supported the deterrent of murder because they proveded valuable information about the states. I think murder was also a deterrent because many of the states also adopted harsher parole rules. ": 1,
          "I think the study tried to argue that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder. They presented evidence that it had an inconclusive impact on the murder rate.  Their methodology seemed a bit weak, so I think they were trying to reach that conclusion.": 1,
          "I think the survey brought out good points that capital punhiment is not a deterent for crime. They also did a survey on another 10 states and the research material was the same.": 1,
          "i think they are trying to study these situations": 1,
          "I think they laid out the facts and you can't really argue with statistics.": 1,
          "I think they were trying to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent of murder. They also made sure to prove that the states that started the death penalty also gave parole more leinancy. I think that this was to aid their research and make a stronger argument towards the death penalty.": 1,
          "I think they were unbiased because their study came out inconclusive and they didn't try to tweak the data at all to support a side.": 1,
          "I think this did not support the capital punishment or opposed it. If I had to choose one I would say it support the capital punishment. I think this study support the capital because of my own biased toward capital punishment. I think most people would look at this study as inconclusive.": 1,
          "I think this is good interesting facts but it only looks at the year after inforcing capital punishment and I dont think that is enough data to prove anything. Laws are made for many years, not just 1 and I think they should look at the 5 and 10 year marks to see significant data. I think that way they will see that the murder rate will decrease soon after 1 year. ": 1,
          "I think this study did a better job of being more convincing since it used more states. I would still prefer all states be compared.": 1,

I would agree that this data does not support the notion that capital punishment reduces murder rates.  It does however, lack credibility in that it only looks at a point by point comparison for 2012.  I would also argue that the reasoning on both sides of the argument that individuals who are about to murder another human take time to make a logical choice about whether or not to proceed based on the laws in their state is foolish.  In summary, if I was trying to decide if capital punishment in a state lowered the murder rates, I would be inlined to think it did not based on this information.": 1,
          "I think this was a much better test, although I don't think there is a positive answer to this question with any amount of testing.  I think the general makeup of the state provides a much better comparison and feel confident based on what was presented in this study, that capital punishment doesn't mead to more murders and it might even deter it.": 1,

But altogether, a study with 14 is going to be more conclusive. However, this study, as well as the other one just isn't really that convincing because they don't really have any hardcore, or significant evidence, it's all kind of even and inconclusive.": 1,

I would have liked to have known why those two states were so different than the others.": 1,
          "I thought that the evidence shows no exact effect of capital punishment.  Because some states the rate lowered and in other states the crime rate grew.  So therefore with the even results one can not determine if Capital punishment is working.": 1,

It seems to strongly support the argument that capital punishment IS a deterrent to murder and I like that the main criticism with the study was answered with a replication that involved a separate set of states.

But this study also has the same problem it does not show how many actual convicted and sentenced to death were actually put to death.

I think if the states aren't showing they will follow through people see the law as lenient.": 1,

I would've like to have seen statistics for all crime such as theft, assault, or rape included to make this study more thorough.  As for murder though, this study adds credibility to the idea that the death penalty does zilch to deter it.  I'd list why that is but I already compiled that in a previous text box concerning the Palmer and Crandall (2012) study.  Furthermore, is it ever morally justifiable to kill?  Is it morally justifiable to give one group a monopoly on killing (government / justice system)?  Does this not mean everyone is complicit in murder if they are apart of the society that is involved in murdering those under the death penalty.  These studies do little to sway or re-enforce my opinion on capital punishment.  Moral arguments have already done so. It doesn't work, nor is it ever right to kill someone unless in cases of self-defense. It certainly doesn't solve the problem of crime or murder, those are societal issues and possibly educational issues that we need to address as a country / community.": 1,

The murder rate also seems like a statistic that would be prone to large shifts year to year, regardless of any policy changes, as well as one that might need to be looked at in a much lengthier segment of time than a year to year shift in order to account for the fluctuations in order to see if there is any sort of trend. Even if the data had indicated more for or against the argument I don't think the study can be used to support or not support the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder.": 1,

          "Like the other study, it was too inconclusive to support the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. If the results leaned toward a lower crime rate in more of the states that allow capital punishment, that would indicate it's a deterrent, but the results were evenly split.": 1,

          "Murder rates were lower in states with higher instances of capital punishment.": 1,
          "My main problem with the study was that while two cities or states may seem similar, they are in fact always different. Just because one city has capital punishment may not be the only factor in why it may or may not have a lower murder rate. ": 1,
          "My original thought was that comparing neighboring states would produce very little of value, though after reading about the methodology and how things were set up, I have a little more faith in the researchers.  While still not a great endorsement of capital punishment, I don't feel this study was as flawed as the previous one.": 1,
          "n/a": 1,
          "Neighboring states did have lower murder rates if they had capital punishment. I don't think this study is taking a wide enough scope on the states they chose.

By this, I meant that I thought the evidence was good to show that the death penalty was NOT deterring murders.  I think this way because this study tried to control many variables while studying the main difference - the existence and use of the death penalty.  The data did not show a significant finding one way or another that the death penalty changed the murder rate significantly.  ": 1,
          "Once again the evidence is inconclusive. I would think it would be a very difficult study to focus because of the many variables that occur in the degree of use of capital punishment, demographic match-ups, etc. Again, it could be argued since there is no clear reduction in the murder rates there is a somewhat limited deterring effect.": 1,

          "Once again, I still feel that capital punishment is needed. I feel that these rates aren't based on the fact that each of these states have capital punishment or just recently adopted it. Crime rates rise! It's just a fact of life.": 1,
          "One cannot argue with numbers. It is pretty clear that the evidence shows that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder based on the evidence shown.": 1,

I do think that it demonstrated that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder (although it didn't convince me), since it took into account more variables (metropolitan size, similar populations since they're neighboring states) and tried to control for them. ": 1,
          "Picking neighboring states, even controlling for similar urbanization populations, does not feel very controlled. The states have different laws, tourism, trades, and hundreds of other variables. To me, it seems that there are too many uncontrolled variables for this study to prove anything. Maybe repeating the study with pairs also align that both have or do not have capital punishment and see how those numbers stack up.": 1,

          "That fact to me is that no matter what you try to do murder will always exist but, the same murderer doesn't have to. There for I think Capital Punishment still deterrents murder by reducing the amount of people one murder can kill. ": 1,

They used neighboring states and controlled for urbanization, but I don't know if and how they controlled for other contributing factors that affect the murder rate.  They also only compared each pair of states for the year 2012, but not other years.  It's possible that for other years, the trend they observed is the opposite.": 1,

The difference might tip the scales rather than leaving the results as \\\\inconclusive\\\\": 1,

          "The data do not support the idea that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because the study concluded that the implementation of capital punishment did not have a conclusive effect on the murder rate.  As a result, we can not say that capital punishment does or does not result in decreased murder rates.": 1,

          "The evidence was inconclusive. This shows that the researchers were not looking to prove either side of the debate. They simply collected the data in a method that insured fairness. A reader of the study would find the same amount of evidence supporting both sides. It would not help the reader decide on anything. It was completely neutral.": 1,

Perhaps there is a short term reduction in murder rates but over time the rates return to normal? Not even considering yearly fluctuations or other changes as suggested by critics, one single year compared to another doesn't say anything to convince me. My personal opinion is that the death penalty doesn't deter or promote crime so I realize that I've just voiced strong disagreement with two pro-capital punishment studies but I do not consider myself particularly biased - there is nothing here that convinces me. This is akin to anecdotal evidence - at least the other study had an excuse for a small sample size, there are only so many states to draw from much less those that fit the criteria. In this case it's inexcusable to have chosen one single year and say it is indicative of anything.": 1,

          "The most recent chart again shows little change if any that someone would not murder based on whether or not the state had capital punishment.  According to the research parole had little effect as well.  Therefore combining both studies it appears that capital punishment doesn't really deter a crime.  ": 1,

          "The numbers were actually compelling and only one variable was able to be measured, murder rate. Unlike the last study which took place over time with more uncontrollable variables this one was nice and precise in what they wanted.

          "The researchers concluded that capital punishment does not deter murder. The crime rate being higher the year before and after the adoption of capital punishment is their evidence. What they fail to explain is the states that did have a lower murder rate after the capital punishment laws were adopted. Neglecting data to prove a point is very reckless.": 1,
          "The researchers not only tested their hypothesis on 10 states - when questioned about the methodology, they also selected another set of state pairs to consider, and got the same findings - that the death penalty is a crime deterrent. ": 1,
          "The researchers study the murder rate in a number of states across a two year span.  In the first year the states did not have capital punishment, in the second year, the states did have capital punishment.  They found that in a majority of the states, the murder rate dropped.  Based off this, they concluded that capital punishment would deter murder.": 1,
          "The researchers themselves opposed capital punishment, and I think they may have manipulated the data in order to get the results they needed. I have no experience with scientific research, but I think that unbiased research is of utmost importance. This study shows that capital punishment alone clearly does not reduce violent crime rates. The results point that introducing capital punishment does not deter violent crimes, but just the opposite - they are on the rise. ": 1,
          "The researchers were pretty clear in their opinion of capital punishment. They flat out said it didn't work as a deterrent, and was ineffective in preventing crime. The critics' arguments implied that the researchers selectively manipulated the facts to fit their conclusions.": 1,

          "The results of the data was not in favor or against it. It was equally effective, out of 10 states, 4 showed lowere murder rates and 4 did not, while 2 of the states stayed the same. This study does not provide any relevant data to be for or against capital punishment as a deterrent.": 1,
          "The results of the study were otherwise unclear (in my opinion) due to the fact that it yielded indeterminent results; the researches also generalized crime (lumping the murder rate in with other crimes) so as to see the overall effect of capital punishment on criminals. There were also several other factors that may have caused a different yield as opposed to just having capital punishment, including stricter or more lenient policies on parole, etc.": 1,
          "The results of this study was inconclusive, because the murder rates were split evenly, so we cannot decide whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent at all.": 1,
          "The results of this study were inconclusive.  It is not possible to show that the study showed results favoring one way or the other because part of the states showed one way and the parts showed favor to the other way.": 1,
          "The results seem pretty inconclusive - if some states experienced increases, and others experienced decreases, it could be that capital punishment has no deterrent effect.": 1,

          "the results showing a deterrent effect would probably be conclusive enough for many people who did not have a strong opinion one way or the other. ": 1,

          "The results were inconclusive, so the study neither favored or opposed capital punishment.": 1,
          "The results were inconclusive. This speaks for itself. Correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, even if the majority of the states showed a decrease in crime following the implementation of the capital punishment laws, one could not say with certainty it was because of the laws. There could be a variety of things that could impact a state's crime rate. For example, if the economy improves, people have more money and less people will be forced to commit crime for various reasons. This is why that I feel the study neither supported nor opposed the argument. ": 1,
          "The second \\\\study\\\\ seems to have more scientific control data, but again we are not presented with enough data to make a solid decision. This study at least compared states that had roughly the same urbanization etc...I would like to see the murder rate over a much longer period of time though. Compare that to the national average, and then go back and look at when laws were enacted that deal with violent crime and see what effect those laws have. Don't simply concentrate on the death penalty. Again, we are left with too little information.": 1,
          "The side by side comparison of similar states is a good way to show whether you think the death penalty is convincing or not.  It shows that a large majority of the states sampled showed lower crime rate that a neighboring state that didn't have the death penalty.  Although it is hard to tell whether the death penalty was the reason for the decrease.": 1,

If the state has a policy that life is too valuable to subject even heinous criminals to execution, then it tends to raise the value of life overall.  If execution is implemented on a widespread level, it shows that the state (and its citizens) have little consideration for life.": 1,
          "The study seemed inconclusive and poorly done. Since the results were inconclusive, I don't think it's fair to say that the results of the study supported capital punishment.": 1,
          "The study seemed inconclusive. The arguement really led to no conclusion. It neither supports nor denies that capital punishment deters murder. ": 1,
          "The study seemed like it didn't take enough into consideration, focusing narrowly on its own interpretation of what makes capital punishment effective or not": 1,
          "The study seemed like nonsense to me - I find it very hard to believe that you can find 20 pairs of neighboring states and control for differences in crime rates, urbanization, etc. I think there are intangible things that just can't be accounted for. Also, there is a logical flaw in their hypothesis - what if states enacted capital punishment BECAUSE the murder rates were so high to begin with? I don't think their study can separate those two possibilities.": 1,
          "The study seemed to cherry pick data in order to support a theory. A more broad study may have came to a different result.": 1,
          "The study seemed to support capital punishment because the results showed lower murder rates after capital punishment was voted into law.": 1,
          "The study seemed very well done, and the authors didn't appear to have a bias. It looks like they carefully controlled for the most important variables. Better still, the results were replicated in another experiement. An unbiased, well run study with replicatable results is fairly convincing. As both studies found that murder rates were not lower in most of the states without capital punishment, and this is a decent piece of evidence against the deterrent effect of capital punishment.": 1,
          "The study seems highly selective, and the reasoning for the choice of states is not well defined.": 1,
          "The study seems to indicate that the existence of capital punishment laws has no effect on murder rates in a given state. Obviously the possible criticisms that can be made should keep us from drawing too broad of a conclusion (for one thing, any speculation about a particular state with or without such a punishment is entirely counterfactual), but it does at least suggest that capital punishment *isn't* working as a deterrent overall. Of course this is hard to reconcile with the prior study, which suggests further studies need to be done examining whether one or both of them are based on faulty assumptions.": 1,
          "The study seems to show a slight lean towards result that the death penalty is not a deterrent ": 1,
          "The study showed how capital punishment did not seem to alter the effect of crime rate. Also, parole seemed to play a larger factor in the study and how the states laws were established, making it more difficult to know what exactly helped the crime and what didn't.": 1,
          "the study showed in two analysis that the murder rate was lower in states that o not have captiol punishment": 1,
          "The study showed that capital punishment had an inconclusive effect on murder rates.  ": 1,

          "The study showed that in the majority of states studied, the murder rate was lower after capital punishment was instated. This would help support the idea that the threat of capital punishment will deter people from committing murder. ": 1,

          "The study showed that some states that adopted capital punishment decreased in murder, others increased, and some did not change. When I looked over the data, the murder rates before and after the adoption of capital punishment in surveyed states is extremely close. The differences between the two (either increase or decrease) were extremely minute. I feel they would be better classified as non-changes, thus rendering all the states has having no changes in murder before and after adopting capital punishment.This study did not support that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "The study showed that the effect of capital punishment on the murder rate is inconclusive.  The results were split about 50/50 in favor and against the hypothesis.": 1,
          "The study showed that the murder rates were lower": 1,
          "The study showed that when states institute the death penalty, murder rates don't decrease.  It's unclear if they increase or not, given the limitations of the study, but the evidence doesn't support a deterrent effect.": 1,
          "The study showed the difference in murder rate between the year before capital punishment was instated and the year after. In almost all cases, the murder rate was lower once capital punishment was put into affect.": 1,
          "The study shows that after the death penalty was implemented the murder rates went down.": 1,
          "The study shows that implementing capital punishment leads to a raise in violence and murder, disproving the argument that capital punishment works as a deterrent.": 1,
          "The study shows the Before and After of the installation of capital punishment. It is different from the other survey in the fact that it only compares an area to itself instead of to another area.": 1,
          "The study stated that they were for capital punishment.": 1,
          "The study supported capital punishment because it showed lower murder rates in 8 of 10 states that had the death penalty.  ": 1,

          "The study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, because it demonstrated that murder rates in a sample group of states decreased after those states instituted the death penalty.": 1,
          "The study supports capital punishment being a deterrent to murder because neighboring states with similar demographics had lower murder rates with the death penalty being used. ": 1,
          "The study supports the capital punishment argument due to the evidence of states with capital punishment having a lower crime rate than their neighboring states that don't allow capital punishment, with eight of of ten pairs of states showing a reduction in murder.": 1,
          "The study takes a look at rates before capital punishment was instituted in those states. This helps their credibility as it is harder to falsify past evidence.": 1,

          "The study used different demographics to compare the states and the outcome was pretty much the same both times.": 1,
          "The study used such a small time frame that it is impossible to determine if the states' murder rates were SOLELY affected by capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "The study was a total joke as a scientific endeavor.  You don't take two years in a vacuum and use that to prove anything.  Crime rates aren't flat, they change year to year, and this study made no effort to include the data on how the murder rate had changed year to year before any reinstatement of the death penalty.  It sound like a Fox News investigation, let's find numbers that support our side and do nothing to put them in context.": 1,
          "The study was about even in my opinion and I think the authors where in favor of it. As before the study looked to be conducted well and they even had a revision in light of criticisim.": 1,
          "The study was almost entirely focused on reasons for the death penalty as a deterrent. The study did not seem as legitimate due to the selection nature of the study. That made me feel as though the results could have been skewed based on the location changing. Since the study presented more information in favor of, I wondered if the conductors of the study choose those location on purpose.  ": 1,
          "the study was complete": 1,
          "The study was excellent and very detailed; you see the numbers for yourself.  The death penalty works and serves as a huge deterrent.": 1,
          "The study was flawed and complicated. ": 1,
          "The study was generally well controlled, taking into account geography and urbanization. Again, though, taking into account data from more years would make the study more convincing.": 1,
          "The study was inconclusive, which in and of itself implies that captital punishment does not strongly deter people from murdering others (if it did, we would have seen some trend in their data).  Thus, it implies that, at best, capital punishment only very weakly deters murder.": 1,
          "The study was not particularly conclusive at all. A virtually equal number of states fell into one of the three categories (increased murders, decreased murders, no change in murders). It's difficult to draw any meaningful conclusion except that the either hypothesis (that capital punishment increases/decreases murder rates) wasn't proved. Nothing was disproved.": 1,
          "The study was not really conclusive either way. They thought adoptoin of capital punishment would show a decrease in murders but it didn't always, and there were some arguments that crime as a whole had dropped due to other factors. ": 1,
          "The study was pretty much neutral and pointed out that murder rates fluctuate so often that it's hard to determine if capital punishment actually does deter murderers.": 1,
          "The study was really good.  It really showed how the adoption of capital punishment helped to reduce the murder rate across most states.": 1,
          "The study was very inconclusive, in fact the results were completely random. ": 1,
          "The study would help people arguing for capital punishment because it shows, even if only a little, that capital punishment does have an effect on crime rates.": 1,
          "The study, in my opinion, shows that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder, as in several states, the murder rate actually increased after capital punishment was adopted. ": 1,
          "The study's end result was indeterminate, pointing to the fact that capital punishment is not a solid deterrent to murder.  I would say it does not support the argument.": 1,

          "The total rate lowered is more than the rate highered.": 1,
          "The usage of 10 states seems very arbitrary. Why not just use all of the possible states for the study. These leads to me to believe that the data was cherry picked to back up a specific opinion, ie. for capital punishment.": 1,
          "The use of comparison between two states with opposing laws on capital punishment provided some evidence that capital punishment does not deter someone from murder. ": 1,

          "The whole study was inconclusive so it didn't provide evidence for or against capital punishment.": 1,
          "Their biased study was all about how it didnt do anything tp deter murder": 1,
          "Their data proves capital punishment works by comparing it to neighboring states with and without capital punishment. If they were against they would not publish this data.": 1,
          "There are many other factors for why the crime rate is lower in those states than the ones that border them.": 1,
          "There are more factors other than capital punishment that determines crime rates.": 1,
          "There are numerous reasons why murder rates could vary in bordering states, and some states are widely different from one part to the next, i.e. east Texas probably doesnt have that much in common with New Mexico.": 1,
          "There are too many factors that could have affected the murder rate besides the adoption of the death penalty. The test is too small to get a real idea if it was the death penalty that caused the change.": 1,
          "There doesn't seem to be any bias because they limited their factors. The fact that they looked into urbanization and etc when choosing their states makes me believe this study is more thought out than the other.": 1,
          "There is no way to correct for all of the factors in this study, like alterations in laws governing parole, or a poor economy leading to more crime (which could in turn result in a higher murder rate). It's impossible to directly correlate a rise in the murder rate with the change of a single state law. Therefore, this is not a scientific study and is merely supposition.": 1,
          "There was a pretty solid lack of a conclusion based on the study done. It didn't give any conclusive information at all.": 1,
          "there was nothing conclusive.  so it had no effect when looking at sets of neighboring states w/differing capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "There were too many variables and not enough years studied.  The tougher parole on convicts would make the numbers drop.": 1,
          "There's so many flaws with the basic premise to this study.  What do neighboring states have to do with anything?  Is the thought that murders will travel out of state to kill someone, and flock to closer, more lenient states?  That's not even addressing the fact brought up in the criticism that most states have multiple neighbors.  I'm sure you could do the inverse study where a state without the death penalty has a neighboring state that does have the death penalty, but with a higher murder rate.": 1,
          "These researchers did a much more thorough investigation into the subject. This study was fact based where everything was on an equal plane.": 1,
          "These researchers showed that in the first study, in eight out of ten pairs of states the state that had the death penalty had lower rates of murder, and in a subsequent replication, seven out of ten states with the death penalty had lower rates of murder, signifying capital punishment might actually deter murder.": 1,
          "These statistics seem more difficult to manipulate than the previous study, and are more consistent.  ": 1,
          "These stats seem to show the opposite outcome as the last study.  It seems like the stats can be made to support either side of the argument.": 1,
          "these two studies seemed to have taken more outboundaries and information into consideration": 1,
          "They argued it as a deterrant for crimes.": 1,
          "They compared neighboring states that both had and didn't have capital punishment, and showed states that had the death penalty had a lower crime rate.": 1,
          "They designed their study to study the effects of the death penalty in order to get results that would favor one side": 1,
          "They did the same as the other researchers and believe that the murder rates were lower in states that had death penalties.": 1,
          "They didn't consider other factors and the study says there are more murders after the death penalty.": 1,
          "They didn't pick states with equal starting conditions. The states were not similar and cannot be compared.": 1,
          "They didn't set valid controls, so I don't consider the study to be valid.": 1,
          "They don't really say that they are from either side. They also tried to validate their study by running it again.": 1,
          "They examined a fair number of states and by looking at adjoining pairs they helped to reduce the effect regional and sub-cultural differences might have on the results..  Though no mention was made about how many of the original 20 states were also used when the study was successfully replicated, the fact that it was successfully replicated with different pairings is provocative (I'm a little reserved on this point, though as they said different pairings not states).  I think all of the preceding shows an attempt at taking a representative sample.  The fact that they tried to control for outside factors like urban density is also the mark of better testing procedure.  They also chose only those states where the murder laws had been in place for at least 5 years, eliminating the possibility of a temporary aberration in the figures.   Interestingly enough, the difference in murder rates are even greater here than in the first study,, suggesting a greater statistical significance.  All this makes their findings more trustworthy.": 1,
          "They pointed out fairly convincingly that there were more than 50% of the instances when murder stayed the same or got worse. This doesn't show a positive coorilation to the support of capital punishment.": 1,
          "They pointed out statistics that said that the murder rate went down, in all but one state, I think state K, after the capital punishment law went into effect. They think that the rates going down is evidence that capital punishment is effective, because would-be criminals know that it's a possibility.": 1,
          "THey released a study showing after capital punishment was introduced it lowered the murder rate": 1,
          "They seemed slightly opposed since they kept saying it was higher even with, but there was not determining factors of which states had more or less.": 1,
          "They seemed to be pushing the issue  heavily that if capital punishment was present murder rates were increased.": 1,
          "They seemed to twist the numbers in a way to show the death penalty works": 1,
          "they shouldnt have chosen such a close group of states or even if they did make sure the laws are similar": 1,
          "they showed evidence that after the death penalty was put in effect murder rates fell": 1,
          "They showed in most cases after a state implemented the death penalty that the murder rate increased. ": 1,
          "They showed were in favor by showing a decrease in murders in areas that had started useing a death penalty.": 1,
          "they support capital punishment  because they said the murder rate should be lower in the states  with capital punishment ": 1,
          "they talked about how the states with it did notice an oppsite effect with higher rates ": 1,
          "They were clearly showing that capital punishment doesn't deter the crimes. 5 showed that it lowered after and 5 showed that it raised after. The rest were the same. Pretty much proving that it doesn't really change anything. ": 1,
          "They were presenting assumptions about people being less able to bail in states where capitol punishment was lower. They also mentioned that crimes reduced.": 1,
          "They were quoted as giving reasoning that if capital punishment actually worked then the murder rates would have decreased in certain states, but they did not. They replied to criticism by showing that while it may be effective in some states, in others it was not, so it was, at best, inconclusive as to if capital punishment actually worked.": 1,
          "They were suggesting that the rates were relatively unchanged in states with the capital punishment compared to those without. This is an argumentative standpoint in favor of opposing capital punishment's efficacy.": 1,
          "This argument seemed like it had convincing data regarding the increase of crime when capital punishment was instated, but with other laws enacted at the same time, it seems like the results might change if they were taken into account. ": 1,
          "This did not convince me that the death penalty deters murder. Sure, most of the state pairs exhibited lower murder rates in the states with the death penalty, but the two pairs with the greatest difference between state murder rates exhibited a much higher murder rate in the state WITH the death penalty instated. The study also made no mention of confounding factors such as education and gun control in the chosen states. Choosing urbanization as the only factor linked to crime in oversimplistic and discriminatory.": 1,
          "THIS IS A LOT BETTER STUDY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE.  COMPARING URBAN POPULATION AND SIMILARITIES IN THE BORDERING STATES THAT HAVE OPPOSITE VIEWS ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IS ACUTALLY A VALID ONE.  AFTER RECIEVEING THE CRITISICM ABOUT COMPARING DIFFERENT STATES THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME AND SHOWED A FAVORITISM TOWARDS THE USE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMWENT.": 1,
          "This is an appallingly bad study. Most violent criminals are not especially civic-minded, and would likely neither know of or care about the recent establishment of capital punishment in the state or states they happened to be committing acts of mayhem that particular week. At very least, it would take several high profile executions over several years to bang into their heads that a possible legal consequence to their criminal acts might be their eventual state-sanctioned death. /  / One year is a ridiculously short time period to measure results.": 1,
          "This is essentially the same as the previous one. Only part of the states were studied, not all. I understand that this was a study to see changes in the rates when a state recently adopted capital punishment but regardless, they only reviewed murder rates not overall crime rates. Was this done because murder is the only crime that will receive the death penalty? ": 1,
          "This is similar to the last graph. There is no statistical data and therefore without this, I disagree that this shows support that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.  /  / Additionally, 1 year is definitely a really low sample size. This is clearly not enough data to show that capital punishment has an effect on murder rate.  /  / Lastly, What about the states that have higher murder rates after capital punishment law? ": 1,
          "This is the kind of data I would expect--that in the situation, it is very difficult to ascertain a clear impact of capital punishment on murder rates. I feel that precisely because there is no clear impact of the capital punishment policy, that a severe and irreversible punishment like the death penalty is unjustified. I do not see how a state can demand the death of an individual if that is not a clear deterrent for the crime which it punishes.": 1,
          "This new study allowed  people to see that even when different states were involved in reconsideration, the evidence pointed out that the end result was essentially the same; that capital punishment worked as a deterrent towards murder.": 1,
          "This one also proved or disproved nothing. The results were split.": 1,
          "This one as well shows that in nearly all cases, capital punishment works as a deterrent.  With the exception of a couple states, the death penalty works.  Though this one is less convincing  it still shows in favor of capital punishment": 1,
          "This one is even more outrageous, especially considering it's only 2 years totaled being monitored. I could see those values raise and lower year to year anyway. They are still trying to negate the effectiveness of the death penalty.": 1,
          "This one is more damning of capital punishment.  The results (8 out of 10) are much less balanced.  It seems to show that capital punishment doesn't work as a deterrent. /  / However, one caveat:  it might be that the states that enacted capital punishment did it as a result of higher murder rates, so it may be a chicken or the egg type of situation.": 1,
          "This one showed neither because the data was all over the place.": 1,
          "This particular study seemed unbiased.": 1,
          "This research clearly depicted capital punishment failing, having actually higher murder rates,": 1,
          "This research opposes the deterrent effect of the death penalty. 12 out of 14 states passed or reinstated capital punishment.  Rates went up.": 1,
          "This second study showed that murder rates were actually higher in states that imposed the death penalty one year later, so this would not support that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "This seemed biased.": 1,
          "This showed that capital punishment is not a deterrent by considering factors such as population and whether the states actually utilized capital punishment and still showed that it does not deter murders.": 1,
          "This showed through a more thorough analysis that states with capital punishment when compared to similar states without typically had lower murder rates. Capital punishment may be a deterrent.": 1,
          "This shows that adopting the death penalty can cause the number of death to decrease per year. ": 1,
          "This shows that relatively similar states (in that they're located in the same general location) have different crime rates based on the presence of capital punishment. Since the crime rates are lower in states with capital punishment, the study would suggest it is the main factor responsible for the difference.": 1,
          "This studies results showed that capital punishment does not deter murder, though I feel that only taking data from a year before and after the adoption of the death penalty is not a large enough pool of data to obtain reliable results. ": 1,
          "This study (as described here, at least) seems much more careful in isolating related and unrelated factors in the outcome. Looking only at states which had capital punishment for a number of years, and had actually carried out executions, for example, would help to ensure that we are seeing true effects of capital punishment laws.": 1,
          "This study also doesn't show conclusive evidence that capital punishment has a significant effect on number of murders": 1,
          "This study attempts to show that the presence of capital punishment laws actually spikes murder rates. ": 1,
          "This study compared neighboring states, and states that had the death penatly typically had higher murder rates.  I think it is a poor study because how do you know which states to compare?  ": 1,
          "This study did a good job of trying only to compare similar states, which should help to account for many extra factors which could affect crime rates. The fact that there is no clear lowering of the crime rates in states with the death penalty should be sufficient to show that any reduction in crime they may cause (whatever small effect that may be) absolutely does not justify the practice of execution.": 1,
          "This study further underscores the value of valid supportive data. In this case the data is inconclusive or irrelevant it would seem.": 1,
          "This study included only some factors that measured crime rates. A more extensive study would have yielded very different results.": 1,
          "This study is about the same as the first one, except it takes population and other factors into account, making the results more linear. It was also repeated with different sets of states and the results were the same.": 1,
          "This study is better since it is able to make better comparisons (since the pairs of states border each other). The group of statistics seems better thought-out and supports the theory better.": 1,
          "This study is even more convincing than the prior one, in establishing the actual data via comparison with state actual practices and common borders.": 1,
          "This study is meant to be for capitol punishment, but the critiques of the study point out a lot of flaws that make the study seem very ineffective. So, after looking at both, I would say it leans more against capitol punishment.": 1,
          "This study is more convincing (to me) than the other, because the states are being compared only to themselves. My issue, again, is that the results aren't as vast as I would have liked them to be in order to sway me fully in favor of the death penalty, but it does make me consider it.": 1,
          "This study is more convincing that the first one, but I still am not totally convinced. There are always more factors at play when talking about crime rate than a single act of legislation. ": 1,
          "This study looks too closely at the addition of the death penalty by just looking at the following year it was instated.  There is not enough time for the dust to settle as one may say.  The first study looked at states that actually have used the death penalty, and that is a much bigger message to criminals than 'we now have it'.  We all can name states that have the death penalty, like new york, and will probably never use it.  Criminals, as dumb as they are, know this.  I also wonder why these states added the death penalty, was crime already on the rise?  This stat could be at the top as the state was reactionaryto an upward trend leading to those numbers, and maybe given more time it will drop.  The first study just seemed more complete and more accurate over time. ": 1,
          "This study makes a slightly stronger case in that the results were replicated when applied to different states. ": 1,
          "This study makes it appear that capital punishment is unnecessary and does not act as a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "This study more clearly shows the non-effect of capital punishment than the first study. Since 8 out of 10 pairs show that states that institute capital punishment actually have higher murder rates than their non-capital punishment counterparts, it seems to be that capital punishment does not deter potential murders.": 1,
          "This study proved absolutely nothing other than it seems to make no difference. Results were literally split down the middle. While performed quite well, and an interesting study, the results only seem to prove that capital punishment doesn't affect anything.": 1,
          "This study seemed less bias. It used a bigger sampling data and there were states where crome wasn't lower.": 1,
          "This study seemed to have very few controls regarding other mitigating factors and cannot give any light as to causation": 1,
          "This study seems more causal - it compares murder rates before and after.  Thus, it seems pretty compelling.  I'm not sure of the interpretation, though. I'm not convinced that having a death penalty will change the perceptions of a culture to be more violent in just a year.  /  / I'm still not sure that the differences are meaningful.  It looked like that the rates were really similar or in the opposite direction for the majority of states (thus, the effect could have been driven by just a few).  It would be more helpful to look at the rates for a period greater than a year (to ensure that people know the law, and that the effect isn't driven by a change itself.": 1,
          "This study seems more reasonable to me, though the sample size, as the critics pointed out was rather small. I think the fact that the study was replicated with different states and ended roughly with the same results, lends some validation.  It doesn't support or oppose capital punishment one way or the orther as a deterrent. It said it was inconclusive. ": 1,
          "This study seems to paint a much clearer picture. There are still numerous variables to account for, but the study does a good job of eliminating some of the biggest variables that could skew the results. However, it would be more convincing to see a longer spread of time rather than just two years. Five years before and after would be better.": 1,
          "this study showed state that shared a border, the state with capital punishment laws had a lower muder rate supporting the deterrent to murder theory.": 1,
          "This study showed that capital punishment actually lead to higher murder rates, so it is probably against the death penalty. ": 1,
          "This study showed that capital punishment does work as a deterent for murder. They showed that in neighboring states, one having the death penalty and the other state not, the murder rate was lower in states that have the death penalty.": 1,
          "This study showed that while people were punished for murder, it didn't seem to affect what their peers did.  Murders committed by gangs, organized crime groups, or in domestic crime situations, aren't typically the type where the murderer is concerned about the penalty at the time of the crime.  The study supports that beyond a point, additional penalties don't deter people further.": 1,
          "This study shows how scatter-shot the results of the death penalty is. I feel that it wasn't intended to prop either side of the argument up, since they actually showed their mixed results (twice, counting when they used ten other states).": 1,
          "This study shows much more support for capital punishment. They data is quit clear that after it was instated then murders went down.": 1,
          "This study shows pretty evenly whether capital punishment is a deterrent to murder or not.": 1,
          "This study shows the effectiveness of capital punishment.": 1,
          "This study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder by presenting fairly substantial differences in the murder rates of two neighboring states with similar conditions, the main difference being the use of capital punishment. It was a more effective study than the last because they were able to replicate their results when presented with doubt, and they removed other factors very well that may have skewed the results.": 1,
          "This study supported the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. Although the results were inconclusive, they were trying here to show a positive correlation, that muder rates were affected by a change in punishment. In this study, the aim was to show that the murder rate was affected by the enactment of capital punishment. /  / The study differs from the previous study in that as opposed to showing a passive situation acting as an influence (looking for a positive or negative affect due to a constant), this current study is showing an active change acting as an influence (looking for a positive or negative affect due to a change).  /  / Since this current study did not find the positive correlation between enactment of capital punishment laws and an increase in murder rate (instead it was the opposite or constant) then the study is actively showing that the murder rate primarily either moves down or stays the same when capital punishment laws are enacted. Thus, it proves the hypothesis that capital punishment is a deterrent. /  / The study, however as critics pointed out, is flawed because it does not account for changing times or for other surrounding factors like parole rates.": 1,
          "This study supports the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder because it shows comparisons between murder rates in states that recently adopted the death penalty. In every state, the murder rate dropped compared to the year before the death penalty was adopted.": 1,
          "This study supports the argument. I dont think it is as convincing as the previous study because of the design. A follow up longitudinal study might have been needed to fully address the arguments of those who are pro death penalty.": 1,
          "This study took multiple aspects to come to their conclusion making it read as a less biased study.  It does support the argument that capitol punishment is a deterrent for committing a crime.  The study would not likely change a person who is against capitol punishment on moral or religious grounds though.": 1,
          "This study was a simple one, studying the murder rates in states that implemented a death penalty in the year prior to the law and the year following the law.  I didn't find the data convincing for the same reasons as the previous example - there's a huge difference in murder rates from state to state, the murder rate was only reported to two significant digits (and the difference was only by 1 in the last significant digit in several cases.)  My main question was what is the typical variability in murder rates in these states year over year?   If the authors had that data, and the murder rate drop was statistically significant in more or more states, that would be a quick rejoinder to the critics, which was not apparently made.": 1,
          "This study was conduct much better! This study compared similar areas with different capital punishment laws; as such in this study the geographic areas yielded much better results. This study was comparing apples to apples in terms of location. Moreover, the authors clearly conceded that previous studies have failed to prove that murder rates could have been reduced just based on the consequence of capital punishment.": 1,
          "This study was not in support to capital punishment. It's thought that cause some states went up it was not working.": 1,
          "This study, just like the other one presented data supporting that states that have capital punishment laws actually have higher murder rates than neighboring states that don't have capital punishment laws. This being said, capital punishment laws don't appear to be a deterrent to murder and might even be considered to encourage additional murders. For these reasons I believe the study provided an argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent to murder.": 1,
          "This study, like the previous study, fails to recognize that it is only in very rare circumstances in which a threat of the death penalty will cause a person to reconsider murder.  The death penalty is not a deterrent; it is retribution.  Any \\\\study\\\\ otherwise is plainly flawed.  I am unable to conceive a situation in which a potential capital murder assailant changes his mind because of the death penalty statute.  (Note, it is important to point out that the death penalty is generally reserved for \\\\capital\\\\ offenses).  Both studies are flawed in this regard.": 1,
          "This study, to me, clearly demonstrated that capital punishment does not act as a deterrent, since the murder rates were lower in all but two capital punishment states.": 1,
          "This was pretty clear that the states with capital punishment did have lower murder rates. This is what would the researchers expected. They seemed to use sound research methods and looked at demographics that would effect the results. ": 1,
          "too many variables that weren't considered.  ": 1,
          "Two unbiased researchers compared data of ten different states using slightly different criteria and the results showed a decrease in capital punishment.   ": 1,
          "Unfortunately, the whole situation in which the study is performed is dependent on the idea that people are rational a large amount of the time, and that as they are about to commit crimes pull out the blue book to see what the possible penalties that they may face for that crime. I don't believe that people are that rational. / The study might be presented as evidence for the idea that a capital punishment law increases the murder rate, but I don't believe that rational people would back that. / Again, I don't base my position on capital punishment on whether one person dying will keep others from commiting the same crime. It is about the person who commited the crime, NOT future criminals.": 1,
          "Unlike the first study which examined the same state this one took 2 different states.  WIthout examining other factors that might cause a correlation I don't think it's as convincing as examining the same state enacting or getting rid of capital punishment": 1,
          "Variables such as urbanization WERE included in thge study and the study was duplicated with similar results using ten different pairs of cities": 1,
          "Well they compare states with and without death penalty.  I feel this one is a bit bias like the other one but I feel like I been jerk around.  Each state is different even ones that are neighboring.  Alabama is different then florida and they are neighboring.  ": 1,
          "Well, I was informed before reading about the study that the researchers were opposed to capital punishment.": 1,
          "What were the p and r values? Were the results statistically significant? The researchers should have accounted for more factors, not just degree of urbanization. Like the previous study, this one was not very well done (and hence does not make a good argument).": 1,
          "When capital punishment was implemented, it was actually coorelated with an increase in murder. This was the very oposite of the intended effect.": 1,
          "When similar states are paired up and the main difference between them is the existence of Capital Punishment, the probability of a greater murder rate in the one with Capital Punishment is 70 to 80 %.": 1,
          "While the number of states with lower murder rates outnumbered those with higher rates, the efficacy of capital punishment should be determined by the change in rate by population.  ": 1,
          "While the results seem to correlate the death penalty with lower crime rates they do not appear to be significantly changed and correlation is not causation. ": 1,
          "While we seem to see a general trend that the implentation of the deathc penalty has lowered murder rates in most states, the differences were, mostly, minimal differences. This changes may not be outside the normal range of rate change from year to year.": 1,
          "With only 2 exceptions, it proved that in the same general area, the threat of capital punishment deters murder.  I remember hearing about how murders occur more often in hot weather, which makes me guess it's more common in southern states, so I appreciate they made an effort to compare states which would have similar climates.": 1,
          "With results showing that areas in similar vicinities showed rates of higher crime in areas with capital punishment, I feel that it's pretty clear evidence that capital punishment does not help lower crime. It was a fairly unbiased survey. A follow-up survey supported the results.": 1
