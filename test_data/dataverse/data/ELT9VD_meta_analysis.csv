Given the paucity of information usually available about lower court nominees, senators are also likely to take account of presidential preferences in assessing each appointee; as the Senate diverges ideologically from the president, we would expect to see the Senate proceed more slowly. Thus the Senate should take longer to confirm nominees slated for critical circuits. As ideological differences between the chair and the president increase, the Senate should take longer to reach a decision on the nominee. Thus the Senate should take longer to render a decision on the affected nominee if a homestate senator is ideologically distant from the president. Thus, we should see a slow down in confirmation when the president's opposition controls the Senate. Thus, if the home-state senator is an ideological outlier relative to the president, the Senate should take longer to act on the nominee.

AJPS14,Maltzman and Shipan,2008,AJPS,AP,7,"Taken together, these arguments suggest that unified government will produce longer-lasting laws. Thus, our first hypothesis captures the idea that original legislative agreements will last longer when Congress and the president are controlled by one party; and conversely, that laws passed when parties share control of government are more likely to be amended. Laws enacted during periods of divided government are more likely to be amended than those enacted under unified control. By broadening the scope of policy views that must be incorporated into final policy choices, the potential for writing durable law is compromised. This leads us to the following hypothesis: The greater the policy disagreement between the House and Senate, the greater the probability of amendment. Overall, then, we would expect that subsequent political conditions, in addition to the conditions at the time of enactment, will affect the stability of public laws. The following two hypotheses capture this idea: During periods of divided government, existing major laws are less likely to be amended. The greater the policy differences between the two chambers, the less likely it is that existing major laws will be amended. Given the interaction of the Court and Congress, we would expect to find a systematic influence of Court activity on Congress's treatment of public laws: The greater the at tention of the Supreme Court to the policy area of a public law, the more likely the law will be amended. As such, both opponents and proponents of the initial law are more likely to pursue future amendments. Hence, we propose the following relationship between complexity and durability: Major laws that are more complex are more likely to be amended. Thus, we expect that laws that are more contested and that narrowly pass will be more susceptible to future revisions: Major laws adopted by slim majorities are more likely to be amended.",Changes to hazard rate,,,Compute % change in hazard rate based on covariate profiles,4169,4026,,,,,4026
AJPS15,Martin,2004,AJPS,CP,3,"Bills dealing with important issues can deliver greater benefits to coalition members, thereby giving them incentives not to engage in activities that will delay their enactment. In general, however, the effect of issue saliency should depend upon the level of divisiveness. For bills on which government partners and the party of the proposing minister are not significantly divided, the more salient the issues involved, the higher these policy benefits will be for all coalition partners, and thus the more likely that they will wish to move quickly to get these bills enacted. For bills on which government partners and the party ofthe proposing minister are extremely divided, saliency should have a much smaller, or even negative, effect. Thus, we should expect coalition parties to move more quickly (i.e., engage in less monitoring) on more salient legislation if the issues involved are relatively nondivisive, but we should expect them to move less quickly (i.e., engage in more monitoring) on more salient legislation if the issues involved are divisive. Similarly, the effect of the divisiveness of an issue should depend upon its saliency. That is, although an increase in divisiveness, for the reasons discussed above, should always lead to greater delay in the introduction of a bill. If coalition partners use the monitoring and control devices available to them in this way, in keeping with their policy goals, then we should expect the government policy agenda to be organized in an accommodative fashion that is, bills on the agenda should be ordered in such a way that those dealing with relatively ""attractive"" issues from the point of view of coalition members (e.g., important issues that do not divide coalition partners from the party holding the relevant ministry) will receive priority in scheduling while those dealing with relatively ""unattractive"" issues will be postponed. it will have a direct effect on delay in the introduction of the proposal, since such intense scrutiny (and back-andforth bargaining with the proposing minister) can take a considerable amount of time. Even if most ofthe scrutiny of the proposal takes place after the cabinet allows it to be placed on the agenda (i.e., in parliamentary committees through the legislative party groups of coalition partners), the anticipation of this scrutiny (and possibly sweeping amendments or legislative rejection of the bill) can exert a powerful ex ante influence over the actions ofa minister (Martin and Vanberg 2004). Thus, a minister drafting a proposal dealing with a particularly controversial issue for the coalition has an inducement to initiate bargaining with other parties and their parliamentary groups before the bill is even brought to the cabinet (and, in the extreme, if the minister expects such bargaining to result in a particularly unfavorable policy outcome from his point of view, his ability to ""keep the gates closed"" can result in the proposal being shelved indefinitely).11 In this way, the monitoring and control ability of coalition members can also indirectly cause the delay of relatively ""unattractive"" legislation. In contrast, on an issue dimension that does not divide the party ofthe proposing minister from its partners, legislation should not be subjected to a great amount of scrutiny, especially if it deals with issues important enough to coalition members that they wish to get it pushed through to passage as quickly as possible. Thus, we should expect particularly ""attractive"" legislation for coalition members to receive priority in scheduling on the legislative agenda.",Changes to hazard rate,,,Compute % change in hazard rate based on covariate profiles,833,,,,,,833

Second, it creates incentives for an ideologically credible challenger to advance her/his electoral possibilities by denouncing policy adoption. this article analyzes the impact of political competition on policy adoption by looking both at the incentives of the incumbent and those of her/his challenger. We call this measure legislative advantage and expect that policy adoption will become more likely as the incumbent's relative power increases. We expect that higher polarization reflects a lack of prior legislative cooperation between the challenger and the incumbent that facilitates the use of legislative obstruction by the challenger. We expect the three variables and the interaction to have a negative effect on policy adoption. Policy reform should be less likely where fewer constraints to policy change exist. We expect single-party majority governments to face fewer constraints on their ability to adopt reforms than governments that have to negotiate with colaition partners or that need to bargain with other parties in order to construct a legislative majority.

APSR2,Box-Steffensmeier et al.,1997,APSR,AP,10,"The expected effect of union membership on timing, however, is best conceptualized in terms of the homogeneity of the district. Thus, we expect that representatives with either high or low unionization in their district received clear signals about NAFTA and thus were likely to make their vote decision earlier  than colleagues with mixed union representation in their district. We expect the latter, without a clear signal regarding their optimal position on NAFTA, to hedge their position and delay their announcement. On the question of timing, the salience of NAFTA for such districts should increase the strength of signal a member receives from constituents. As a result, border districts should have a positive effect on the timing of the vote decision, meaning that representatives of such districts would announce earlier than nonborder colleagues. So the effect on the timing of a member's decision is like that of union membership: Low or high Perot support implies an earlier announcement, while median levels indicate delay. With respect to timing, as for previous variables, high or low values for household income are expected to compel earlier announcements, and values in the middle range to cause delay in taking a position. We also expect members who receive a large proportion of donations from either source to announce their position earlier. With regard to timing, we expect that the most ideological members will declare their position early. Liberal members with high unionization in their district will declare their position early, while liberals with low unionization in their district receive conflicting signals, that is, their constituency factors suggest voting for NAFTA, while their ideological and policy predispositions suggest voting against it, and thus delaying their announcement. The process for conservatives is similar: Those from low-union districts receive a constituency signal consistent with their personal preference, while those from high-union districts find their preference at odds with that of constituents. The same relationship also holds for household income in the district: Low-income values for liberal members and high ones for conservatives are compatible signals and are consistent with early position taking, while the reverse  circumstances indicate contradictory forces that prompt members to delay their decision. To be an effective cue-giver, a leader needs to announce early. Because of disagreement in the Democratic leadership regarding NAFTA, we included variables that represent the Republican Leadership and Democratic Leadership. In addition, a Committee Membership variable was included in the timing model to test whether members of committees that took action on NAFTA also announced their decision early, since they could attempt to act as cue-givers based on their institutional position of committee expertise.",Changes to hazard rate,,,Compute % change in hazard rate based on covariate profiles,433,,,,,,433

However, their approach does not identify how the arrival of information about the performance of the minister and the government he serves affects length of service; provides no insight into the strategic use of a Prime MinisterÍs power of dismissal; and cannot separate the effect of background characteristics from performance. First piece of information to be different is that the Prime Minister will reward those ministers who perform well with longer tenure relative to those who perform poorly. This hypothesis suggests that a ministerÍs hazard rate is higher when facing a resignation call. Our second hypothesis is that, since the Prime Minister is often forced to rely on noisy information about individual ministersÍ performance, she should turn to information on the performance of all ministers and reward and punish individual ministers according to their performance relative to the governmentÍs overall. In using all the information that is available to evaluate the performance of her ith minister the Prime Minister will compare the individual measures of performance against the level of cr. Keeping constant individual performance an increase in cr should make the minister less vulnerable. It follows that, if relative performance evaluation is an important determinant of ministerial tenure, expected tenure should be decreasing.",Hazard ratios,Changes to hazard rate,,Compute % change in hazard rate based on covariate profiles,25572,,,,,,25572

In general, there are few empirical studies of bargaining delays in the real world (Diermeier and van Roozendaal 1998; Golder 2010; Martin and Vanberg 2003). Most of the studies that exist, though, focus on explaining delays in terms of either uncertainty or bargaining complexity.In Table 4, we examine how policy weight b, the raw number of parties m, the effective number of parties, and ideological diversity affect bargaining delays. The first column presents results from a model in which we use ordinary least squares (OLS) to regress bargaining delays on our covariates using the weighted simulation data. OLS may be problematic in this context, though, because the distribution of delays is not normally distributed (see Figure 3,) delays have to be positive, and some delays are right-censored.",Only sign and significance of coefficient estimates,,,Cox model is a minor part of the analysis,50000,,,,,,50000

One may also expect extensive leave policies where unions are stronger. we may also expect that more proportional electoral systems favor leave policies. The adoption of childcare leave policies is modeled from 1970 to 2000, and the key independent variable will be the proportion of women in parliament. EHA is the best method to analyze the timing of the initial adoption of childcare policies. Standard linear regression models do not appropriately account for change in the probability of policy adoption across time, within each country. At any point in time, a country possesses a particular probability of policy adoption. Standard regression models do not incorporate past probability into the future probability of policy adoption, which is necessary here. Furthermore, within each country, EHA techniques allow us to account for left censure (a policy already in place) and right censure (a policy was never observed to have been adopted) (see Box-Steffensmeier and Jones 1997, 2004).",Hazard ratios,,,Bad description of Cox model,557,,,,,,557

The most direct representation of electoral performance is seat share. We therefore hypothesize that party leadersÍ risk of removal from that position declines as their partiesÍ seat share rises. In other words, a party leaderÍs job security increases directly with the partyÍs seat share. Seat share is not the only indication of electoral performance, however, especially for minor parties, which, despite relatively small seat shares, can form part of a governing coalition. We therefore also examine the effect that being in government has on a party leaderÍs survival. We hypothesize that party leadersÍ risk of removal decreases if their party is in government.

BJPS4,Berlinski et al.,2007,BJPS,CP,3,"To analyse length of tenure we look at the duration  of each ministerial spell. An intuitive approach is to relate durability to the performance of a minister in the job. In this article we do not include performance variables, focusing instead on characteristics of a minister which may or may not be related to performance. Our primary concern in this article is to highlight those characteristics of ministers that might increase the length of time a minister survives which, borrowing from the government duration literature, we refer to as ministerial durability.  In much the same way that the durability of cabinets is subject to random shocks, ministers too can be seen as subject to random events that may lead to the termination of a ministerial spell. However, there may also be characteristics of individual ministers and of governments that enhance a ministerÍs survival capacity. Our aim in this article is to provide the first description of the characteristics that lead to ministerial durability. We focus on three sets of attributes: (i) personal characteristics of the minister; (ii) political characteristics of the minister, and (iii) characteristics pertaining to the government in which the minister serves. We find that educational background increases ministersÍ capacity to survive, that female ministers have lower hazard rates and older ministers have higher ones. Experienced ministers have higher hazard rates than newly appointed ones. Ministerial rank increases a ministersÍ capacity to survive, with full cabinet members having the lowest hazard rates in our sample. We use different strategies to control for the characteristics of the government in which the ministers serve. Our results are robust to any of these controls.",Hazard ratios,Empirical estimate of hazard and/or survival functions,,,3638,,,,,,3638

It can be expected that in these situations the durations of the formation processes are longer, since in these cases the party leaders typically face a challenge in their own party or are even replaced. It is therefore expected that the duration of caretaker cabinet formation is shorter. It shortens the time needed to select a proposer, but it also allows the incumbent cabinet to start negotiations while still in office, since it is common knowledge that it will be the proposer. Thus, we expect that the presence of the continuation rule leads to shorter negotiation processes. But since any suchrequirement is common knowledge among the negotiators, we expect no difference with respect to formation times.
