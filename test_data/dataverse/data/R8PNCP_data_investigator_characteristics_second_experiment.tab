The reason I say that is because many other countries would NEVER see a woman as a powerful leader, and I have a feeling some Muslim countries wouldn't even recognize her.  The would throw a chador on her and put her in a kitchen.  Seriously, could you see the President of the United States being required to cover her head/face in the presence of a group of Muslim men?

My full scholarship allowed me to go to college. My expenses were airfare, rent, food, books and all utilities (which were a lot as heating was not cheap). I worked 2 jobs through college (kitchen and grocery store). I also worked in a pottery studio in exchange for studio space as it was more valuable than money. Both my jobs paid 8 dollars an hour and that was higher than the state's min. wage. Both jobs were way more work than what was technically required because they did not want to hire an extra person. My coworkers and I stayed late without overtime all the time. Customers were arrogant, didn't treat us like people but rather like servants. The cafe part of the grocery closed an hour early so we could wash down everything. People would demand that they get special treatment and sometimes they got their way while treating us like crap - pushing our closing to 11 pm instead of 10. People really don't understand the behind the scenes of food service. They demand endless supply and freak out when ingredient shipments don't arrive due to snow/ice storms. The hate around food workers not deserving living wage is disgusting. Anyone who spends 40 -50 hours on anything deserves to be paid fairly. At least enough to compensate for the dehumanizing aspects of the job. I worked full time at one job and it covered my expenses but I never had a chance to save up even for an emergency fund. I never paid for food because I got leftovers from the Kitchen. The grocery job put expired items in the break room fridge so there was that. I want food workers to get paid more or have more power in saying no to entitled customers."	2		""	1		0	1	0	0	0	0	""	2	""	"I think it's about relating to others."	-99	-99	-99	-99	-99	"QRaceResen|Q3|A2|Q2|Q8|A1|Q4|Q9"
