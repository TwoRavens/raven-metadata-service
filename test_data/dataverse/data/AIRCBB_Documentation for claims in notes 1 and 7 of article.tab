"Articles in 2005 issues of AJPS, APSR or JOP estimating at least one binary dependent variable model using logit or probit"	"NOTE 1:              What is the author's stated rationale for using logit or probit?           (1) No defense offered, (2) Defense is that the dependent variable is binary, (3) Other explicit defense is offered"	"NOTE 1:                             Specifically, what defense is offered for the choice of logit or probit?"

[Yes,No]"	"NOTE 7: Interactive hypothesis in column D predicts that the effects of the two variables are  monotonic. [Yes,No]"
