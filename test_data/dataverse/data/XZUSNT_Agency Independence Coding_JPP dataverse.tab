"Description"	""						""									
"The dataset covers 29 countries in Africa from 1990-2007. Data collection included all countries on the African continent and several islands off the coast, that are included in conventional references to African countries.  Those countries for which legislation could not be found or for which data was judged to be mostly incomplete were excluded. Only the countries that the final sample analyzed are included in the dataverse file."	""						""

"Coding Rules"	""						""									
"The guiding principles in coding are clear formal mandates regarding what the agency can and cannot do; what the chain of command is; who the agency answers to; how the personnel of the agency are selected; whether the agency has the responsibility to select; value; and sell SOEs for privatization.  Where the legislation is vague or does not address the expertise or responsibility of the agency, we left the cell blank. We do not assume that if something is not specified, it is forbidden or allowed (see Hanretty and Koop, 2011).  On the other hand, the lack of specificity in legislation suggests that there is room for political discretion.  Therefore, aspects of legislation must explicitly state what is allowed or forbidden in order to receive a score of 0 or 1.  See <Bureaucratic Independence Coding Rules.docx> for item-level coding rule details."	""						""
