"While the field is pretty large right now for canidates, there are a few promising ones. I am personally really excited to see how donald trump does._"	"For the Republican party, Donald Trump is certainly a surprise with how well he is doing in the recent polls considering his numerous controversial statements. It is still too early to tell if his lead will hold on throughout the race. The Democrats however, seem to have two viable candidates with Clinton and Sanders. It was widely believed that Clinton would have a relatively easy time gaining the nomination until the recent surge in Sanders popularity. As with the Republicans, the Democratic nomination race is far to early to call._"	"2016 presidential candidates are not set in stone, however it would seem that the democrats have more solid choices. Republican candidate Donald Trump is mired in controversy and while he is presently doing well in the polls, his style of off the cuff remarks may end up leading to trouble. Clinton has lost whatever edge she seemingly had with the emergence of Sanders, but both have a chance at grabbing the nomination."

The best option, in my opinion, is Bernie Sanders. He's the only one who has consistently stuck by his choices and words in the past. The only other real democratic option is Hillary Clinton, and she has shown in the past that her opinions change with the wind (or more accurately, the money.) When it comes to Republicans, there are many more options than Democrats. But they're all awful. The end!"

"The list of 2016 presidential is pretty broad but also fairly lacking. There aren't really any exciting candidates who would bring new ideas to the table, with the exception of fringe candidates like Bernie Sanders or maybe Rand Paul, so I don't think there's much chance of any huge systemic changes being made after 2016, regardless of who is elected. In all likelihood, the Democratic nominee will be Hillary Clinton, so the real question is who will make it to the finish line on the Republican side. It's hard to say for sure at this early stage, with Donald Trump leading the polls presently, but if I were to guess, I'd say that someone like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker, or maybe Marco Rubio, will probably be on the final ballot in 2016. It's really hard to say at this juncture."	"I don't think the race for president will be very climactic. Hillary Clinton is certain to win the Democratic nomination, with Bernie Sanders as her only competition. Sanders does not have enough support to defeat Clinton. For the Republicans, there are a lot of pretty standard candidates. Given their history, it seems that a moderate like Jeb Bush would end up with the nomination, or a standard, more conservative establishment type like Scott Walker. Both are pretty typical Republicans. At least Donald Trump will keep things entertaining."	"I know how much you all hate Hilary, but I'm pretty sure she's got this one in the bag and she has my vote.

"A very large group of people running for the presidential election in 2016. They range from the comical, the predestined, to the man I hope they win."	"During the 2016 election I want you to know that we need a strong leader._ I told you that Obama was a bad choice but you voted for him anyways._ I hope you understand that we need somebody that will help get our country out of this debt crisis._ I hope you understand that our economy relies on our country not being in debt to other countries. Please vote wisely this time."	"I think the choices in 2016 are very clear, we can choose to turn back the clock and vote for candidates that would forget about the financial turmoil that we went through and reverse the limited measures that have been taken to control big financial companies.  We need a strong consumer advocate and someone concerned about the smaller and smaller piece of the economic pie that workers are getting and we need a candidate that will not rashly involve us in foreign wars and countries without clear and compelling evidence that it is necessary to defend our country. Bernie Sanders is that man.  Unlike Jeb Bush he has been a consistent critic of the financial institutions, an opponent of the Iraq war and an advocate for the common man.  Unlike Walker he is not the favorite  puppet of a billionaire and advocate of big business.  Unlike Hillary is not tied to the bureaucratic Presidents of the past or a failed Secretary of State who was asleep while the middle east fell apart."

"I think it's a sad crew of folks running, especially on the republican side._ Let's just elect Hilary, a not wonderful choice but the best of the bunch, and get on with things!"	"Vote Democrat. Non of the Republicans are any good. Some have even embarresed themselves lately (even with other Republicans). The others have mostly questionable records. I am voting for whomever the Democrats nominate."	"While neither party is stellar, clearly Democrats should continue to be elected back into office. The hate and vitriol from the Republican party is counterproductive and frankly frightening. Please at least consider Democrat before Republican."

"Hey friends, I just saw the names of the 2016 presidential candidates and the list was pretty interesting. I thought that the most interesting names were Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. It would be interesting to have a female run America. That would be very historic. Donald Trump has no business running for President. He would just make America fall apart._"	"Donald Trump really would be a disastrous choice for president in my opinion._ It's foolish for a man_ who has twice gone bankrupt to argue that he knows how to run things better than anyone else._ He is also openly racist and will add to already rising racial tensions._Hilary Clinton would be a historic choice but I urge people to familiarize themselves with lesser known candidates too."	"With the field of candidates available, it's optimal that you do your homework and learn as much as you can about them so that you can make an informed decision on election day."

"We need to elect a person who will make America strong in military and economy. The last 7 years have been an embarassment to the world. The world thinks that we are weak. Our economy is not better except that the rich got richer."	"More than a dozen Republicans and a handful of Democrats have announced they are running for their party's 2016 presidential nomination._ I plan on voting for Hillary Clinton for president."	"You might not think that your vote will do much to change anything in America, but I really think that any vote really does count. You should consider voting in the 2016 election, but make sure you are knowledgable about the candidates on either side! For example, Hilary Clinton is running! Her husband was president before as you know and she has a lot of experience in politics. She might be a good candidate, don't you think?
