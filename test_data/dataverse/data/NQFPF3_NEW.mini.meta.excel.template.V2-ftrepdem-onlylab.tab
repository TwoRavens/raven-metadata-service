"My OSF:"				"https://osf.io/6tfh5/ "								
"The only modification I made in this version was to clarify the formula headings."				""								
"This OSF also contains other relevant meta-analysis resources, so be sure check it out!"				""								
""				""								
"What is different about this template compared to the one I made for the SPPC mini meta article"				""								
"This Excel template is a modification of my previous Excel mini meta template using guideline from David Wilson's book and website: http://mason.gmu.edu/~dwilsonb/ma.html"				""								
"It is easier to add studies in this template."				""								
"Z is no longer calculated in the Stouffer's method. Instead, Z here is calculated based on the mean effect size and its standard error."				""								
"95% confidence interval is now included."				""								
"You can now calculate meta-analysis based on Cohen's d (between subject) without converting d to r."				""								
"Instead of weighting by sample size, meta-analysis of d uses inverse variance weighting."				""								
"You can now calculate odds ratio effect size for binary outcomes (2 x 2 Chi Square) and odds ratio meta-analysis!"				""								
"For the moment, the meta-analyses here only use fixed-effect approach!! Random effects and homogeneity test are yet to come. See David Wilson's slides for details."				""								
""				""								
"Menu Options:"				""								
"There are 5 tabs below (not including this one)."				""								
"Tabs 1 and 2 are between-group comparison (i.e., Cohen's d). Tab 1 calculates Cohen's d using s pooled, and Tab 2 calculates the fixed-effect meta-analysis. "				""								
"Tab 3 is for meta-analyzing correlations."				""								
"Tabs 4 and 5 are for binary outcomes. Tab 4 calculates the odds ratio effect size, and Tab 5 calculates the meta-analysis. "				""								
"Tab 6 is for converting effect sizes (useful if studies have different designs and need to convert all ES to same metric)."				""								
""				""								
"This is designed to be as simple as possible. All you need to do is enter the number into the yellow boxes and your results will come out in the orange boxes!"				""								
"All the steps are shown to help you learn and understand the meta-analytic procedures."				""								
"Modify the Spreadsheet to accommodate the number of studies you have but be sure the formulas are not affected. "				""								
"Donâ€™t see your answers after you filled in all the info? Just scroll right and it might be hidden there!!"				""								
"Don't see other tabs? See those arrows at the very bottom left corner? Click those to scroll through."				""								
"I checked all the numbers with the CMA software and they check out! But let me know if there is any mistake please!!!!!!!"				""								
"If you have any question, please feel free to contact me at jin.x.goh@gmail.com! Seriously, don't be shy! I'll try my best to help!!"				""								
"Happy meta-analyzing!!"				""
