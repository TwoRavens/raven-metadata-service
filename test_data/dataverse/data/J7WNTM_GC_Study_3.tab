Seeing the actual numbers, and how small the change was in most of the states in which the rate lowered, supported my view that capital punishment laws likely had not been the cause of the lowered murder rate. The apparent ignorance of the study's authors about the downward trend of crime rates in general, and their lack of explaination for why the change was so small in most of the states in which it lowered, or why rates increased in several states, makes it seem like the study isn't very credible. It seems like the authors were just looking for evidence to support their theory, rather than taking an unbiased look at what the data might actually mean.

My biggest complaint is that the study had no true controls.  They did not compare the data they gathered on states that reinstated capital punishment against the rest of the 50 states that did not change their capital punishment laws.  It's conceivable that the murder rate across the country fell, regardless of capital punishment laws.

If the Kroner and Phillips 2012 study is real, it only looked at one year before and after the adoption of the law.  It's possible that a change in the law causes short term effects that don't last after people get used to the law.  If a state which formerly did not have the death penalty now suddenly does, people will be thinking about capital punishment a lot more than ten years of the death penalty existing.  People will be less used to the death penalty, more afraid of it, and likely would believe it would be used a lot more often and easily than what actually ends up happening.  Once the law is old news, people may go back to their previous behavior.  Also, if people know that right now there is no capital punishment, but there will be or may be next year, that might make them more likely to murder, in order to get it done before they can be killed for it.  So I would guess it's also possible that the year immediately before the adoption of the death penalty might have more murders than previous years.  It is even possible that the year before the change in law could be farther from the average than the year after the change in the law.  I think this study would be more meaningful if they looked at ten or twenty years before and after the change in the law.

That would be my biggest critique; murder is only one crime of many. As a whole it does show that the death penalty doesn't deter murder, which should be self-evident when you look at the motivations for murder.  It's either a crime a passion and the murderer has no care or concern for the reprecussions, it's done for money and again the death penalty doesn't deter hitmen, or it's done because the person is mentally ill and because this person has no concept of right or wrong or gives in to some weird sick twisted desire they again are not detered by capital punishment.

As for murder though, this study adds credibility to the idea that the death penalty does zilch to deter it.  I'd list why that is but I already compiled that in a previous text box concerning the Palmer and Crandall (2012) study.  Furthermore, is it ever morally justifiable to kill?  Is it morally justifiable to give one group a monopoly on killing (government / justice system)?  Does this not mean everyone is complicit in murder if they are apart of the society that is involved in murdering those under the death penalty.  These studies do little to sway or re-enforce my opinion on capital punishment.  Moral arguments have already done so. It doesn't work, nor is it ever right to kill someone unless in cases of self-defense. It certainly doesn't solve the problem of crime or murder, those are societal issues and possibly educational issues that we need to address as a country / community."	45.51	29.364	74.874	165.404	7.0	1.0	0.0	-1.22332214859718	7.0	1.0	0.0	-1.13199876360424	0	0	1.0	1.0	-1.22332214859718	-1.13199876360424	1	1.0
