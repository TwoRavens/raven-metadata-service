"stateassembly"	"Burnham (1986) "	"In the election year, contains governor party, as well as number of seats held by r, d, and up to two other parties in the state senate and state house. According to Moschos and Katsky (1965) all assemblies bicameral in this period. "	"ICPSR_0016/DS00016-DS0001 contains years 1834-1878; ICPSR_0016/DS00016-DS0002 contains years 1879-1923. "	"see stateassembly_notes for governor party codes. Most observations are in even years, which Teele believes is probably the election year, so if Burnham lists the date as 1848, it is assumerd November 1848 was the election and that the new legislature took over in January the following year. By this logic, 1849 and 1850 represent one session year. Hence the value of 1 is added to the years before the dataset is expanded into an annual dataset."
"Machine "	"Teele original, cite Teele (2018)."	"Applies to the 38 states which had at least one city with >25k population in 1900. Variables include # cities in state with machine by year, approx population in state's large cities c.1900, approx pop living in machine city by year, and an indicator of whether one of the cities had machines from more than one party at c.1900"	"This is a state-year dataset with info from 1860-1920. Teele also has city-level info for 1860-1975. "	"A description of the coding process can be found in the online appendix.
