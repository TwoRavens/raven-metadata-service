He's been married to Lydia for 32 years.  He takes the ""personally pro-life"" position on abortion and hedges on gay marriage but indicates no firm opposition.   He's in favor of some new restrictions on gun rights, probably including background checks.  He is a strong supporter of Israel and seems strong overall on foreign policy.
