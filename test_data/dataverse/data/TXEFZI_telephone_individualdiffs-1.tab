"2016 presidential candidates are not set in stone, however it would seem that the democrats have more solid choices. Republican candidate Donald Trump is mired in controversy and while he is presently doing well in the polls, his style of off the cuff remarks may end up leading to trouble. Clinton has lost whatever edge she seemingly had with the emergence of Sanders, but both have a chance at grabbing the nomination."	3	"RDD"	73	1	0	2	0

"At the starting gate we have a ton of presidential candidates, 16 from the rpublican side and 5 from the democratic side. It seems like Hilary Clinton is a lock for the dem's but Bernie sanders will be putting up a good fight. The top three Republicans are Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, and probably Rand Paul. Three distinct candidates all with their own flavor."	3	"RDD"	66	1	0	3	1

"Have you been keeping track of Donald Trump's campaign? He really is a clown. It's terrifying that he is proving to be more popular among the right-wing crowd than any of the other people trying to grab the republican nomination. Bernie Sanders is more interesting than Hilary Clinton, and I really wish he would win the Democratic nomination. If he did, I think he would have a smaller chance of actually wining the election than Hilary would."	3	"RRD"	81	1	1	4	1
"Hello All, the candidate with policy views closest to my own opinions is Bernie Sanders.

He sounded like a Republican so go figure.  Anyway, the good news is that he also thinks Donald Trump will talk himself into a hole.

"Hillary would be a great disaster for our nation. She is a dictator with strong socialist tendencies, connected with other evil and powerful people around the globe to establish the global reign of terror and bring USA down. As far as Republicans, another Bush would be just as big of a disaster, we already saw what happened while his clown-of-a-brother was in office, not to mention Bush senior who sold out America to keep his precious oil.

"I think the choices in 2016 are very clear, we can choose to turn back the clock and vote for candidates that would forget about the financial turmoil that we went through and reverse the limited measures that have been taken to control big financial companies.  We need a strong consumer advocate and someone concerned about the smaller and smaller piece of the economic pie that workers are getting and we need a candidate that will not rashly involve us in foreign wars and countries without clear and compelling evidence that it is necessary to defend our country. Bernie Sanders is that man.  Unlike Jeb Bush he has been a consistent critic of the financial institutions, an opponent of the Iraq war and an advocate for the common man.  Unlike Walker he is not the favorite  puppet of a billionaire and advocate of big business.  Unlike Hillary is not tied to the bureaucratic Presidents of the past or a failed Secretary of State who was asleep while the middle east fell apart."	3	"DRD"	173	1	0	3	1
"I think with the 2016 presidential election coming up it is time for us to think about this countries future. It is obvious what has happened when republicans have been in office. War, spending, and a depressed economy.  It is clear we need to vote democrat."	3	"DRD"	47	1	0	1	0

If he wins it will add to the Bush dynasty.  /  / The Democratic side has a few candidates.  Hilary Clinton has a large following and even larger backing from corporations.

"Hi there, This upcoming 2016 election is going to be exciting to say the least, as we have waited 8 years to make a real change now.

"Hey, So this is my take on the 2016 Presidential race: Bernie Sanders: HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Hilary Clinton: Heaven save us all. Martin O'Mally: Could easily turn into the 2016 version of Barack Obama. As for the Republicans? Ted Cruz: Best guy on the right without a doubt. Smart, clear spoken, and principled. Rand Paul: Second best guy, but there's problems there. His thing with McConnel and his stance on Voter ID is troubling. Conversely, his tax plan is the best thing in the world. Carlie Fiorina: I don't know how to spell her name. She sounds nice, in a very sound bite kind of way, but no one knows who she is and I don't think she has enough name recognition to really have any chance. Trump: He's unserious and just looking for press. He'll drop out long before he'll have to face the music of his taxes being published. Ben Carson: He's okay, but he's not politically savvy enough to survive. In the general, he'd get eaten alive by the press. Scott Walker: Probably third best, but he's almost certainly for amnesty, which means he'll never get my vote. Marco Rubio: Turncoat mother fucker. I'd go on talking about the other 15,000 people running for the Republican nomination, but I'm not getting paid enough for that."	2	"DRD"	233	0	0	4	1
"As you all know, I have decided to support Hillary Clinton in 2016. While I don't necessarily love everything she stands for, in my opinion she has the experience and I like the fact that she is married to Bill Clinton. I really liked it when he was president. I think one of the great advantages she has is that she understands how the system is run in Washington. I think that has been one of Obama's biggest struggles: navigating the ridiculous system that is politics in Washington. I can't believe the ridiculous characters the Republicans have running so I won't even go into that now. "	2	"DDD"	111	1	1	3	1

"Hey folk 2016 presidential candidates are up. I see alot of potential candidates. It look like Hillary Clinton will be hitting it hard this year and Jeb Bush is another front runner. I can't believe that Trump is running again. The last thing we need is someone like Trump making the rich more rich and the poor even poorer. I will put my money on Hillary I don't agree with everything she has to say; but compared to the rest of the candidates. She is alot more moderate than most."	1	"DRD"	93	1	0	3	0
"The 2016 presidential candidates is packed full of candidates, expecially republicans."	1	"DDD"	12	1	1	3	1
"There are a lot of candidates for the 2016 presidential election. There are more Republican candidates than Democratic. Each one has different qualifications (and some, like Donald Trump, have seemingly none, yet are polling very well). There is some competition between the Democratic candidates, and many are specifically pitting themselves against and criticizing Hilary Clinton."	1	"RDR"	56	1	1	2	1

"I believe that there are a lot of qualified candidates for the 2016 election. My main hope is that Hillary Clinton is not nominated. She will tear down this country just like Barack Obama has. I believe that we need to turn to the Republican Party. I am in high hopes that the Republican party will bring this nation back up to its greater glory. The united states used to be a free and great country. Lets choose someone that can help the United States instead of hurt the american people."	1	"DDR"	92	0	1	3	0
"All of the candiates suck except for Sanders. No other candiate has a proven track record of sticking with that he says when it comes to his voting history. No other candiate is really against big buisness. He is our best shot at making our country good again."	1	"RDR"	49	1	0	4	0
"There are a lot of really bad candiates out there. A lot of people who aren't work a vote. It's important to understand that very few are qualified and even fewer will do a good job. It's our job to pick our nations leader. I believer that to be Bernie Sanders."	1	"RDD"	55	1	1	3	0
"There are basically two democratic candidates that we have heard about, Clinton and Sanders.  Neither good choices, a socialist or a fraud.  Unfortunately the republican ticket is too crowded, thus not yet creating a united front.  Muddying the waters is Donald Trump, who seems to have nothing good to say about others from his party."	1	"DRD"	56	0	1	3	1
"I guess who you've been guessing will run will be running. There's a couple of surprises- not really surprises but like...really?"	1	"DDD"	25	1	1	3	1
"Look at the yahoos who are the Republican candidates and ask them if they will move our country forward or are just padding their own or their cronies' pockets. Trump is just a circus act. Only Democrats can push our country to more equality and a better future. "	1	"RDD"	49	1	0	3	1
"There's somewhat a variety between the candidates this upcoming election -- from socialist to solid right-wing. I just wanted to tell you that we should pick wisely. We should pick the one who is going to continue the initiatives of our current president. We should not pick those who are opportunist, those who think that government is in the interest of businesses. We should think of the people."	1	"RDD"	70	1	0	4	0
"Bernie Sanders is the only candidate you should seriously consider."	1	"RDR"	11	1	1	3	0
"I would advise you to really do your homework regarding the 2016 presidential candidates. There are a few candidate - Democrats - that I am hopeful for, such as Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders have peaked my interest. As for the Republican candidates that I would like to do more research on are: Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Lindsey Graham. The lists are intimidating and impressive."	1	"DDR"	66	1	1	3	1
"The democrats side looks a little more organized but the republicans side looks like a 3 ring circus. There are so many candidates running it is just crazy. If all this madness with the republicans keeps up it is gonna be an easy Democrat win."	1	"DDD"	46	1	0	3	1
"It's hard to choose a specific candidate. These past few elections so many promises are made only to be altered. They just want to get as many votes as they can to get chosen and make false promises.  Be very careful. Ask questions. Ask for proof. Don't just accept what is said. Ask for progress reports. One can say a lot and do nothing."	1	"RRD"	67	1	1	3	1
"There will be a lot of choice coming up for president.  All have good qualities."	1	"RDD"	16	1	0	3	1
"There are a lot of potential choices. It is a crowded field at the moment and is mostly made up of Republicans. There seems to be many that are in it just for the publicity, I don't see many of them being real candidates in the end."	1	"RDR"	49	1	0	3	0
"The Democrats have a wide variety of candidates - the forerunners are Hilary Clinton, of course, and Bernie Sanders. As far as the Republicans - we have another Bush contender as well as Ted Cruz and Chris Christie, both of whom have been in the media a lot before. "	1	"DDD"	48	1	1	1	1

"There is the whole lot of people that are running for President in 2016.  With the exception of Bernie Saunders (And Elizabeth Warren who is NOT running), I wouldnt elect any of these clowns as President.  Heck, I'd give Romney a second look if this is all we have to chose from. "	1	"RDR"	54	0	0	3	0
"The two most well known names for the Democrats are Hillary Clinton, who has stepped down from the Clinton Foundation to run and Bernie Sanders who mostly identifies as Independent. For the Republicans it is Jeb Bush brother and son to two former presidents and Donald Trump, real estate mogul. "	1	"DDD"	51	1	1	3	1
"There is a handful of people running for the Democratic presidential nomination.  There is a much larger number of people running for the Republican nomination.  It will be interesting how things turn out.  Many will drop out for lack of funding and recognition, and a few more names on either side will be added to the mix."	1	"RDD"	58	0	1	3	1
"There are a ton of presidential candidates in the running for the 2016 presidential campaign. The republican field is absolutely packed. There are a few democrats including hillary clinton."	1	"RDD"	30	0	1	4	1
"2016 is going to be one of the most interesting elections in our nations history.Is historic because there is a real possibility that the US may finally elect its first female president. Then there are more Republican candidates throwing their hats in the ring than ever before. Our country always seems to be divided down this invisible line of liberal and conservative which doesn't actually exist. The big issues will make or break a candidate. Our country needs experienced leadership."	1	"DRD"	83	1	1	3	1
"The 2016 presidential field is a large one adn full of diverse ideas as to where this country is and where it needs to be in the future. It has extreme candidate on both sides, from Bernie Sanders to Donald trump and everythign in between. I urge you to decide what issues are important to you and to then choose the candidate that will best fulfill your expectations."	1	"DDD"	69	0	0	4	1
"The Republicans seem to put a lot of focus on the state of the economy and the importance of national security. The Democratic statements seem to have a lot less focus and seem to be a bit all over the place in terms of platform."	1	"RDD"	46	0	1	3	1
"There are a lot of wack jobs running for President. That is no suprise. They all are talking a great game now, but when it comes down to it they are all just blowing smoke at us. A lot of them are already politicians and they know the ins and outs of doing what it takes to get votes. I am interested to see the things they spew at the debates, because right now I do not see a real stand out that I believe will turn this sinking ship around. Most of them have little concept of the working class America or the quality of life these hard-working people live."	1	"RRD"	113	1	1	3	1
"I think it's a sad crew of folks running, especially on the republican side.  Let's just elect Hilary, a not wonderful choice but the best of the bunch, and get on with things!"	1	"RDD"	36	1	1	3	0
"Hey friends, I just saw the names of the 2016 presidential candidates and the list was pretty interesting. I thought that the most interesting names were Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. It would be interesting to have a female run America. That would be very historic. Donald Trump has no business running for President. He would just make America fall apart. "	1	"DDD"	62	1	0	1	0
"We need to elect a person who will make America strong in military and economy. The last 7 years have been an embarassment to the world. The world thinks that we are weak. Our economy is not better except that the rich got richer."	1	"DDD"	45	0	0	4	1
