	"NOTE ON MISSING DATA IMPUTATION:"	""	""	""	""	""
	""	"* We performed 10 rounds of multiple imputation using all pre-treatment covariates from the survey with imputations produced via predictive mean matching using the"	""	""	""	""
	""	"   ice package in Stata. Code to replicate the missing data imputation is located in the do-file \"lebsurv_impute_REP.do\" included with this replication file. Datasets are denoted by the variable m_impute where "	""	""	""	""
	""	"   m_impute=0 is the original dataset."	""	""	""	""
	""	""	""	""	""	""
	"NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMES:"	""	""	""	""	""
	""	"* Raw variable names generally map to specific questions in the survey instrument where the question number is denoted in the raw variable name and maps to the survey included with these replication files. "	""	""	""	""
	""	"   For example, the raw variable \"q28_birth_yr\" refers to Question 28 in the survey instrument where respondents were asked about their year of birth. "	""	""	""	""
	""	""	""	""	""	""
	"NOTE ON VARIABLE RECODE NAMING CONVENTIONS:"	""	""	""	""	""
	"*All RAW variables listed in Column D are the raw versions of the variables as shared from the survey firm to the authors. Most of these variables were cleaned and recoded for analysis, following a specific naming convention:"	""	""	""	""	""
	""	"* _REC1 denotes the recoding of the variable with all \"Don't know\" \"Refused\" or \"Not Applicable\" recoded as \".\" for missing. These _REC1 versions were used in the imputation to replace missingness. "	""	""	""	""
	""	"* _REC1b includes the \".\" missing recode above, but also reverses the scale of the answer categories from what appears in the hard copy paper version of the survey."	""	""	""	""
	""	"* _REC2 typically denotes a binary version of the raw variable, such as when a 4 category variable has been collapsed into 2 categories, as in 1 \"Strongly Disagree\" 2 \" Weakly Disagree\" 3 \"Weakly Agree\" "	""	""	""	""
	""	"    4 \"Strongly Agree\" becomes 0 \"Disagree\" and 1 \"Agree"	""	""	""	""
	""	"* _REC3 refers to other types of variable recoding that do not fit any of the conventions above"	""	""	""	""
	""	""	""	""	""	""
	"NOTE ON THE INDICES INCLUDED BELOW:"	""	""	""	""	""
