First, the slide in oil prices has been restrained a bit, and WTI crude is up 1.05% to $45.21/bbl. this morning. Second, ECB President Draghi said on Tuesday that eurozone inflation's recent decline was due to temporary factors. While the ECB said on Wednesday that the bond market misinterpreted those remarks by rushing for the exits, there is really no interpreting the word temporary in any other way. Third, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that he might be open to a rate hike in 2017 although not at the Monetary Policy Committee's next meeting. Fourth, this morning's release of German inflation data showed price growth running faster than expected. And fifth, U.S. Q1 GDP growth was revised up this morning. These five elements all met with some very low government bond yields and so Germany's 10-year bund yield is up to 0.44% from 0.24% earlier this week. The sell-off in government bonds has pushed the U.S. 10-yield (shown below) above certain key technical levels.

The European Central Bank said on Wednesday that investors had misinterpreted ECB President Draghi's Tuesday remarks by sending interest rates higher, but markets were not impressed. The sentiment driving trading activity is that holders of government bonds should get ready for hikes from the Bank of England and the ECB, even if the Fed might pause its rate-hike cycle until 2018. A relief rally in oil has also dampened sentiment for U.S. Treasuries as did an upward revision to Q1 real GDP growth (1.4% SAAR vs. second estimate of 1.2%). Treasuries did end above their worst levels, however, because the S&P 500 fell 0.84% to 2,420.3 and generated a flight-to-quality bid.

The upgrade reflects new-found strength in consumer spending and exports.\\n\\nThe result is weaker than 2.1 percent growth in the fourth quarter and matches the growth rate recorded the second quarter of 2016. It is still well below President Donald Trumps ambitious growth targets of the economy growing at more than 3 percent.\\n\\nAnalysts expect growth to accelerate in the second quarter, fueled by solid hiring and an uptick in consumer spending. Estimates from the Atlanta Federal Reserve expect that the economy expanded at an annual pace of 2.9 percent during the April-June quarter.\\n\\nGus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services, said the slow growth at the start of 2017 will prove temporary. Faucher expects the economy to expand at a 2.2 percent pace for the entire year.\\n\\nThe economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular, pace, Faucher said.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of the year, consumer spending grew at faster pace than earlier GDP estimates suggested.

Consumer spending was very weak in the quarter and is also seen unchanged at 0.6 percent growth. Forecasters see the GDP price index holding at 2.2 percent.\\n\\nDefinition\\nGross Domestic Product represents the total value of the country's production during the period and consists of the purchases of domestically-produced goods and services by individuals, businesses, foreigners and government entities. Data are available in nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) dollars, as well as in index form. Economists and market players always monitor the real growth rates generated by the GDP quantity index or the real dollar value. The quantity index measures inflation-adjusted activity, but we are more accustomed to looking at dollar values.\\n\\nHousehold purchases are counted in personal consumption expenditures -- durable goods (such as furniture and cars), nondurable goods (such as clothing and food) and services (such as banking, education and transportation). Private housing purchases are classified as residential investment. Businesses invest in nonresidential structures, durable equipment and computer software. Inventories at all stages of production are counted as investment. Only inventory changes, not levels, are added to GDP.\\n\\nNet exports equal the sum of exports less imports. Exports are the purchases by foreigners of goods and services produced in the United States. Imports represent domestic purchases of foreign-produced goods and services and must be deducted from the calculation of GDP. Government purchases of goods and services are the compensation of government employees and purchases from businesses and abroad. Data show the portion attributed to consumption and investment. Government outlays for transfer payments or interest payments are not included in GDP.\\n\\nThe GDP price index is a comprehensive indicator of inflation. It is typically lower than the consumer price index because investment goods (which are in the GDP price index but not the CPI) tend to have lower rates of inflation than consumer goods and services. Note that contributions of each component, as averaged over the prior year, are tracked in the table below (components do not exactly sum to total due to chain-weighted methodology). Consumption expenditures, otherwise known as consumer spending, has over history been steadily making up an increasing share of GDP.  Why Investors Care Real GDP growth is always quoted at a quarterly annual rate. It measures how much the economy has grown over a three-month period. Quarterly growth rates are often volatile consequently, economists also like to look at the year-over-year growth in GDP. The yearly changes tend to be more stable. \\nData Source: Haver Analytics It is common to compare quarterly changes at annual rates in the GDP deflator. These can be volatile, just like the quarterly swings in real GDP growth as a result, the trend in inflation is better determined by year- over- year changes. \\nData Source: Haver Analytics": 1, "GDP Annualized QoQ 1.4% vs Exp: 1.2%\\n\\nPersonal Consumption 1.1% vs Exp: 0.6%\\n\\nGDP Price Index 1.9% vs Exp: 2.2% vs Prior: 2.2%\\n\\nCore PCE QoQ 2.0% vs Exp: 2.1%\\n\\nInitial Jobless Claims 244k vs Exp: 240k\\n\\nContinuing Claims 1948k vs Exp: 1935k\\n\\nStreet Color alerts are derived from real time chats with market professionals subscribed to the Ask Alyce Premium Chat on Bloomberg and Symphony.

Much of the debate here in Washington has focused on the need to overhaul the corporate tax code. But a new coalition of consumers and industry groups is calling attention to the prospect for major changes for individuals, particularly when it comes to retirement.\\n\\n(voice-over): That`s because the taxes you get to defer on retirement savings are worth $584 billion in federal revenue through 2020.\\n\\nFormer Congressman Jim McCrery works with the Save Our Savings Coalition. He called that a piggy bank that`s tough for lawmakers to resist.\\n\\nJIM MCCRERY, SAVE OUR SAVINGS COALITION: Retirement security pot of money is pretty big, in the United States. So if policymakers are looking for revenue, to do a revenue neutral tax bill, for example, it`s a logical place for them to look. .\\n\\nMUI: In other words, if Washington wants to cut taxes, it needs to find a way to pay for it. Among the proposals the coalition is concerned about, limiting deductions for 401(k)s and IRAs, lowering the cap on how much individuals can contribute and creating a new after-tax universal savings account.\\n\\nRomina Boccia is a policy expert from the conservative Heritage Foundation.

The White House has also said it would preserve the 401(k) deduction.\\n\\nBut the coalition is still worried there`s wiggle room in those promises. Seventy-five percent of private sector workers have access to a retirement plan.

But with so many smartphone makers in the market, what will this mean for the future of the smartphone? And will it be even around in 10 years as we know it today?\\n\\nScott Stein is senior editor at CNET and he joins us now to discuss.\\n\\nScott, I heard someone say that the -- ultimately, the smartphone won`t even have a phone.\\n\\nSCOTT STEIN, CNET SR. EDITOR: Well, that`s the question is. Will you still be looking at a screen? I feel like that`s the part that could end up looking really old-fashioned. As these devices connect easily to other things, do you want to be looking at the screen or do you want to be looking at the thing that connects to. And I think that`s the proposition you see in smart home --\\n\\nMATHISEN: Well, if it connects to my refrigerator, I don`t want to look at my refrigerator. I`d rather look at the screen.\\n\\nSTEIN: Yes, I know. Me too.\\n\\nBut, you know, I think the idea of carrying a huge phone around with me is not always that appealing. I would like it be able to, you know, be smaller in some ways. I think it`s kind of ballooned in size and in ambition.\\n\\nThe other question, too, is how much of that will be controlled outside of screens. I mean, you see a lot of voice connected stuff and I feel like that has is ups and downs, and it`s probably hitting a wall as far as how many things you can do with it.\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also is challenged as far as you know, the idea of artificial intelligence, can they rise up against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others and provide and prove to be a powerhouse in the A.I. field. Also, what you can do with a screen and a phone, possibly augmented reality, which is what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going towards. Now, is that --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nSTEIN: Go ahead.\\n\\nHERERA: Let me go back to something that you mentioned and that is the voice controlled technology. Like the Alexas that are in the house. That seems to be the most immediate challenge to me, to the iPhone and the other smartphone makers. How do they either integrate that, go around it, enterprise things that are better than that?\\n\\nSTEIN: It`s a good question. I think it`s a huge challenge. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri has a lot of issues. It doesn`t work well for me a lot of the time.\\n\\nAnd there`s also a war going on in voice-controlled tech where, you know, whether you`re using Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you`re picking one ecosystem and you can`t talk to multiple A.I.s at once or multiple voices like you can launch apps. So, you know, that`s something -- and if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches more than one device, which they will, with home pod sitting in the home and listening.\\n\\nHow do you handle, how do you talk and have one thing listen or have it do things in an intelligent way. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to tackle that and everyone else needs to as well.\\n\\nMATHISEN: Very quickly, the iPhone 8 is supposed to come out later this year. What do you expect to see on it and will the changes be really evolutionary and incremental, or they could be revolutionary?\\n\\nSTEIN: I think a lot of focus is going to be on the camera. Augmented reality is something that Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are talking a lot about, and that`s going to be in OS. But the camera could actually enable some more 3D scanning type capabilities. I would think that they would push that maybe for the idea of -- combined with A.I. to identify things, to feel like a lens on the world, and to explore how it can map and navigate your world.\\n\\nMATHISEN: Right.\\n\\nSTEIN: That could be used in other types of tech, too. Sure, larger screen and contactless, you know, wireless charging, but I think the camera could stand the most improvements.\\n\\nMATHISEN: All right. Scott, thanks very much. Appreciate your time.\\n\\nSTEIN: Yes, thanks.\\n\\nMATHISEN: We`ll check back with you. Scott Stein with CNET.\\n\\nHERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera.

The previously reported inventory contraction worsened slightly to a -1.11% annual pace (a swing of -2.12% from the prior quarter). Although government spending was revised upward +0.04%, it still contracted during the quarter, removing -0.16% from the headline. \\n\\nThe good news continued to be commercial fixed investment, which although revised downward -0.14% is still now adding +1.71% to the headline. Foreign trade was also revised upward slightly (+0.09%) to a +0.23% contribution to the headline number, up some +2.05% from the prior quarter. \\n\\nThe BEA's \\bottom line\\ (their \\Real Final Sales of Domestic Product\\, which excludes the contracting inventories) was more than a full percent better than the headline at +2.53%, up +1.46% from the 1.07% rate recorded 4Q-2016. \\n\\nReal annualized household disposable income was essentially unchanged at an annualized $39,360 (in 2009 dollars). The household savings rate was revised -0.1% lower to 5.1%. \\n\\nFor the fourth quarter the BEA assumed an effective annualized deflator of 1.94%. During the same quarter (January 2017 through March 2017) the inflation recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in their CPI-U index was lower at 1.54%. Over estimating inflation results in pessimistic growth rates, and if the BEA's \\nominal\\ data was deflated using CPI-U inflation information the headline growth number would have been somewhat higher at a +1.84% annualized growth rate. \\n\\nAmong the notable items in the report : \\n\\n-- The headline contribution from consumer expenditures for goods was still a miniscule +0.11% growth rate (down -1.18% from the prior quarter). \\n\\n-- The contribution to the headline from consumer spending on services strengthened as it was revised upward +0.27% to +0.64% (although that was down -0.47% from the prior quarter). The entirety of the increase came in upward revisions to the costs of healthcare and insurance (+0.38%). The combined consumer contribution to the headline number was +0.75%, down -1.65% from 4Q-2016. \\n\\n-- The headline contribution from commercial private fixed investments was revised downward -0.14% to +1.71%, although that remained +1.25% higher than the prior quarter. That growth was primarily in non-residential construction. \\n\\n-- Inventory contraction deducted -1.11% from the headline number, a downward revision of -0.04% from the previous estimate and down -2.12% from the prior quarter. It is important to remember that the BEA's inventory numbers are exceptionally noisy (and susceptible to significant distortions/anomalies caused by commodity price or currency swings) while ultimately representing a zero reverting (and long term essentially zero sum) series. \\n\\n-- Governmental spending was still reported to be contracting, although at a revised lower annual rate (at -0.16%, down -0.19% from the prior quarter). \\n\\n-- Exports were revised upward +0.13% to a +0.82% contribution to the headline, a +1.37% improvement from the prior quarter. \\n\\n-- Imports were revised downward (-0.04%), and they subtracted -0.59% from the headline number (up +0.68% from the prior quarter).

This is the BEA's \\bottom line\\ measurement of the economy and it excludes the reported inventory contraction. \\n\\n-- As mentioned above, real per-capita annual disposable income was essentially unchanged. At the same time the household savings rate was revised downward again by -0.1%. It is important to keep this line item in perspective: real per-capita annual disposable income is up only +7.32% in aggregate since the second quarter of 2008 -- a meager annualized +0.81% growth rate over the past 35 quarters. The Numbers, As Revised \\nAs a quick reminder, the classic definition of the GDP can be summarized with the following equation: \\nGDP = private consumption + gross private investment + government spending + (exports - imports)\\nor, as it is commonly expressed in algebraic shorthand: \\nGDP = C + I + G + (X-M)\\nIn the new report the values for that equation (total dollars, percentage of the total GDP, and contribution to the final percentage growth number) are as follows: The quarter-to-quarter changes in the contributions that various components make to the overall GDP can be best understood from the table below, which breaks out the component contributions in more detail and over time. In the table below we have split the \\C\\ component into goods and services, split the \\I\\ component into fixed investment and inventories, separated exports from imports, added a line for the BEA's \\Real Final Sales of Domestic Product\\ and listed the quarters in columns with the most current to the left: Summary and Commentary \\n\\nThis revision boosts the headline growth about a quarter percent to +1.42% -- better but still tepid. The notable takeaways from this report are: \\n\\n-- The largest upward revision was in consumer spending for healthcare and insurance. \\n\\n-- The growth rate for consumer spending on goods remains anemic. \\n\\n-- The inventory contraction worsened, possibly in anticipation of softer future consumer spending. \\n\\n-- Foreign trade remained a bright spot and is not a drag on the headline number. \\n\\nThe US consumer may be spending more, but that increased spending is not on discretionary \\life-style\\ goods. And as per usual, the Fed is once again projecting a return to \\normalcy\\ in the form of 3% growth in future quarters -- with consumer spending leading the way. But if this past quarter's pattern persists those consumers may continue to face a toxic mix of stagnant disposable income, rising insurance costs and shrinking savings -- not exactly a formula for happy campers.

The news coming as President Trump prepares to meet the new president of South Korea this afternoon. President Trump, promising a big surprise on health care despite the Senate's vote being delayed, the Commander-in-chief is optimistic a deal will get done. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Doctor Tom Price, weighing in on where things stand earlier this hour.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTOM PRICE, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Before this administration came into office, a third of the counties across this country had one insurance provider to offer any coverage on the exchange. The premiums were going up, deductibles were going up and they're continuing to skyrocket and it is because of the structure of the program. So what we're trying to do again is to fashion a program that allows every single American to have access to the coverage they want.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: The very latest on the health care battle, coming up. Major banks clearing the second round of Federal Reserve Stress Test. All 34 companies got passing grades from Federal Reserve's first time since the tests began in 2011.\\n\\nCooking up an IPO despite the original hype, investors may not be as hungry for Blue Apron as thought. What you can expect from the company's debut today, stock going public at $10.00 a share.\\n\\nWalgreens and Rite Aid called off their merger agreement. Walgreen's will buy more than 2000 stores for nearly $5.5 billion. Rite Aid shares sinking on news. Take a look at the stocks right now, as you see there. Futures indicating the markets will open mixed today. We just are getting the GDP number out. This is a final reading for the first quarter, as you see markets are mixed, not a major reaction to this number but GDP was up 1.4 percent in the first quarter, for the final reading. That is fractionally better than the expectation called for growth of 1.2 percent. Markets pretty much steady ahead of that number and after that number.\\n\\nEuropean markets also mixed today, the FT-100 up a quarter of a percent, that's 20 points higher and the CAC Quarante is down three quarters of one percent, 41 points lower. In Asia overnight, gains across the board. Take a look. Best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.\\n\\nOur top stories this half hour right now, President Trump will meet with South Korean President, Moon Jae-in today in the hopes of building a United Front against North Korea's nuclear threat. National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster said that Obama era policy toward North Korea just won't do it. Watch this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nH.R. MCMASTER, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The threat is much more immediate now. And so it is clear that we can't repeat the same approach, failed approach of the past. So, the President has directed us to not do that and to prepare a range of options including a military option which nobody wants to take, right? Because everybody understands that the severe danger of this situation is the threat to the South Korean population is held hostage.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Secretary of State under President Clinton and the chairman of Albright Stonebridge group, Madeleine Albright. Secretary, it's great to have you on the program this morning, welcome back.\\n\\nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Good to be with you. Thank you, Maria.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, the Secretary is calling for maximum pressure on North Korea through sanctions, while Moon is advocating for more dialogue. What are you expecting from the day's meeting with the new head of South Korea, and how do you see this situation obviously has become more dangerous in the last six months?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: I think it is an extremely dangerous situation. I am very glad that the new President of South Korea is coming here. He does have a different approach. He wants more dialogue with North Korea, I think it is going to be very important for president Trump to listen to what the new President has to say, and I also agree with what Mr. -- General McMaster said which is that there does have to be a look at all the options and it is important to work with our friends and allies, the South Koreans, the Japanese, also to get the Chinese to do more in terms of using their influence and generally being willing to use all the tools in the toolbox.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I think the whole China part of the story is really important. But is China really stopped up in your view? The truth is, I can't believe that China wants too much to change in North Korea. They don't want a democracy and all the refugees coming into China. They don't want to have a problem with North Korea. What can China really do and has it done enough so far?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: Well, there is no reason to think that putting more pressure on the North Koreans will lead to downfall of the whole place, I do think that what is important is the Chinese are the ones that are the biggest suppliers of a variety of products and goods and energy to the North Koreans. I do think they have lot to lose here and they have a lot to gain if they work with the rest of us.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the G20 Summit is taking place next week in Hamburg. The clash between President Trump and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, seems unavoidable. Germany has signaled that the summit will focus on climate change, free trade, global migration, all of the things that the President has talked about that he's against in one form or another.\\n\\nThis will also be the first meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, the head of Russia. Is this summit the place for President Trump to tout his agenda or strive for unity or what? What do you think happens at this G20?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: I think it's going to be quite a summit, exactly the way you described it. This morning, Angela Merkel talked about the fact that climate change was going to be something that she was going to raise, something where I believe President Trump has gone totally in the wrong direction. It will be interesting to see how they have a discussion at all.\\n\\nAnd I think that it's important for him to listen to people in terms of -- that America first is not necessarily the right way to go about building unity. I think it's going to be very interesting to watch in so many ways because they have not met and the question is, to what extent they will actually do some business in terms of trying to lessen the pressures that are out there. I hope that President Trump raises Ukraine with President Putin.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see if that happens. I want to get your take Secretary on the Middle East situation right now. We were just having a conversation a few minutes about the Qataris and Syria. The Trump administration says this is the evidence that the Assad regime is planning another chemical weapons attack. How do you believe the United States should be dealing with Syria right now, if Assad does do another chemical attack?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: Well, I do think that clearly, it's terrible. I think the issue here, Maria, is we don't have enough Syria strategy. Its one thing to do kind of make a lot of statements, but the problem is we don't have a strategy.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, a strategy that would include our allies around the world, right? I mean, how are we going to have allies in the Middle East when we have what's taking place is Qatar, as well? So, the U.S. is facing tension with the Qatari's, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, as you know, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar for reportedly supporting terrorist organizations in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe Trump administration now has to decide to either back Saudi Arabia, take a hard stance against Qatar and the Qataris, which holds U.S. military base. What is your answer to this situation with our base in Qatar and so many of its allies saying they are the supporter of terrorism?\\n\\nALRIGHT: I think it is complicated beyond belief and the way you describe it absolutely right. I think that it is a mistake for us to be perpetuating divisions between Qatar and GCC countries that I have heard that there are some attempt to mediate little bit on this and as you pointed out, we do have a very important base in Qatar. And it complex but we do not need to be contributing to further divisions because the problem's already between the Saudis and the Iranians, is very difficult.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Egypt's third richest person said that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization. He said it doesn't matter what you call them, that's what they are. Do you agree with that?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: I think it is hard to designate having been the person that put a lot of groups on a terrorist organization aspect. I think that we made a mistake, United States and calling for elections too soon in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood was organized. The rest of the political players there were not. I think it is important to understand what is going on in Egypt, what is going on in the religious terrorist conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nBy the way, I think that it is time for the Trump administration to put out national security strategy. By law, that a new administration has to put out a strategy and there are now 57 members of Congress calling for them to put out a national security strategy. Frankly, I followed this very carefully. I have no idea what the Trump administration has in mind for overall strategy in the Middle East or anywhere else frankly.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And it seems the public was largely pleased with his meeting in Saudi Arabia with his foreign trip so far. How is President Trump doing in terms of foreign policy in your view?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: Well, I think that maybe that immediate reaction to Middle East trip is one thing, but then he went to Europe and didn't exactly get a good reaction. And a new pew poll out now where it is very clear that President Trump has very low respect anywhere in the world, and also that the United States has lost its position.\\n\\nI find that hard to deal with because nothing made me prouder than to represent the United States. And I think we need to understand that America's national interests are embedded in what is going on in the rest of the world. I was very troubled when all of a sudden there was a discussion saying we didn't care about the global community, that we are worrying about national interests.\\n\\nOur national interests are very important but they can only be met within a climate where others listen to what we have to say, where there is respect for what we do, and when they understand what our strategy is because we need our allies in place to work with us whether it's in North Korea or the Middle East or in Ukraine, all parts of the world.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: You make a lot of good point, Secretary. Now, you are making a keynote speech dubbed Disinformation Week. What is the goal of the dialogue? Tell us about this Disinformation Week.\\n\\nALBRIGHT: We are in new era for policy. One is disinformation. A lot of it has to do with the way the nation was used there for a number of years to undermine the whole approach of many Ukrainians who want to be part of Europe. Generally, there is a whole way now that information, and information technology is being used in order to confuse people.\\n\\nAnd listening generally, I do think that there is a question these days, in terms of how opinions dominate facts. And so I'm very pleased to be exploring it because highbred warfare is very much a part -- disinformation is very much a part of that. And we need to know who is playing us, frankly. And I think that is important, thank you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: For sure. I want to ask you about your latest tweet. It's getting a lot of talk. Twitter user Jacob Smith posted online saying he took a picture of you driving a car while he was in Uber. You then tweeted this, \\In case you are wondering, I have a five-star rating.\\ Is becoming an Uber driver the next step on career? Why did you do that, Secretary?\\n\\nALBRIGHT: Well, because I have to tell you I do love to drive and I was driving three men to a meeting. And I am a good driver, so five stars is absolutely right.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: All right. Secretary, good to see you today. Thanks so much for joining the conversation. We appreciate your time.\\n\\nALBRIGHT: Good to see you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And to you. Secretary Madeleine Albright, joining us. Stay with us, we will be right back. Stuart Varney on the other side of this break.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back it's something better than nothing when it comes to health care. Joining us right now to weigh in on that question host of \\VARNEY & COMPANY\\ Stuart Varney good morning, Stu.\\n\\nSTUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You've been watching the show haven't you? You see the intent debate that we've had on this program because my position is and I'm sticking to it and I want to know where you stand Maria, my position is something on health care is better than nothing. Let me briefly explain that, the something that we've got in front of us get rid of Obamacare taxes and mandates and lower the deficit.\\n\\nI think that's really good, the alternative the no deal at all means that the Democrats have brought in that means you get more socialized medicine that needs you get essentially Medicaid and Obamacare on steroids. So therefore I say there's something that we've got to offer is better than the nothing which we face and you say.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: I agree with you however is this something include higher taxes does that temper the argument, I mean Dagen, we had on Senator Rounds earlier who said let's keep in the 3.8 investment tax, that Obamacare had isn't that one of the issues for business.\\n\\nDAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, because he is worried about the -- I will argue about the headlines about the you're raising of your can taxes for the rich and kicking people off the Medicaid Stuart, I am absolutely 100 percent in agreement with you and if Republicans don't get on board in doing something in losing these regulations on businesses and cutting this taxes their standing alongside Chuck Schumer with Elizabeth Warren in championing single payer.\\n\\nVARNEY: I did see your interview with Senator Rounds this morning and as you say he's suggesting that you keep the investment tax surcharges. I guess that what it would be called, he wants to keep that so you keep that government revenue coming in, I got it and I understand there's going to be a lot of negotiating jaw boning sausage making right up to the last point. And I would not want to see that that investment tax surcharge stay in, I'd like to see it out but if Bush comes to shot ill take what I can get because I don't want the alternative.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Everybody agree with that? Pete Hegseth, Governor Huckabee.\\n\\nMIKE HUCKABEE,FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Overall, I do but just very quickly I would say that you got to remember these are folks dealing with problems in their own states and they don't want to back and be beat up for taking people off of --\\n\\nMCDOWELL: No, it could lawmakers like and spends their money when they love spending somebody else's money and that's exactly what they're doing.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: A lot of promises time to do something Stuart.\\n\\nVARNEY: Well I've had serious disputes with Governor Huckabee, and with Erik Boland and with Neil and Lou everybody up and down is against me poor little me, I'm just saying give me something, rather than nothing, and I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well just bring it on Stu, we'll see you 10 minutes. I know you got more on this.\\n\\nVARNEY: You will.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Thank you Stuart \\VARNEY & COMPANY\\ begins at the top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. So join Stuart the next 10 minutes, first though Blue Apron set to go public today why investors do not have as much an appetite for the meal delivery services initially expected, next.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back, Blue Apron the latest start up to make it's Wall Street debut the meal delivery service set to begin trading on the New York stock exchange in 35 minutes the priced its IPO at $10 a share it will trade under the symbol APRN, for Apron. Joining us right now, the Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath. Jon, it's good to see you by, the way, Jon.\\n\\nJON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be here, Maria.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: $10.00, a lot lower than the original expectation, which was $15.00 to $17.00 a share. What happened?\\n\\nHILSENRATH: It's a lot lower than that, and it's also hurting the previous round of investors who put money in the pre-pier stage it's below that price. You know, one of the big problems for Blue Apron is Amazon they came out and bought whole foods just, you know, during this road show process, and people are saying well, you know, Amazon is pretty powerful competitor there and we don't know if Blue Apron can make it.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: It's a good point Jon, I want - we're going to watch this stock and see how it trades see if that has any effect on the IPO market in general, let me get your take on the GDP it was up 1.4 percent, what does that tell you?\\n\\nHILSENRATH: Well, you know, everyone was he wringing their hands in January and February about how weak growth looked it turned out it wasn't as weak as everybody expected we're going to get pretty decent numbers in the second quarter, you know, I think the bottom line for this economy is we're going at this two percent rate, that we have been stuck at for most of this expansion, it's rarely as weak as people make it out to me when we get weak quarter like the first quarter but it's not going gang busters yet. It's stuck in this really kind of subpar path.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, no 1.4 percent definitely not gang busters we know that.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Maria can I say one other thing about the Blue Apron IPO, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of people talking about this, today, you know, a lot of talk about maybe the IPO market is weakening, but we should remember, you know, these markets are pretty strong right now, I mean the IPO market in particular, is much stronger right now than it was a year ago. You know, we've had $27 billion worth of IPO's, so far this year that compares to eight billion at this time last year. So when Blue Apron comes out and disappoints we shouldn't take that as a sign that the IPO market is fizzling, I think this is a stock specific case of just a company that has a of tougher business model than investors expected when they went on their road show.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: All right.\\n\\nPETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well Jon just real quick, what `s the biggest thing that could would improve that GDP number second quarter?\\n\\nHILSENRATH: Well, you know some progress on tax and regulatory reform. I think a lot of businesses and consumers are frozen because there's all this talk in Washington about you know, about a shake-up on the tax and regulatory environment, and not happening, I think that uncertainty has to go away.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, all right. We'll be waiting watching that Jon good to see you thanks so much.\\n\\nHILSENRATH: OK, thanks a lot.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: We'll see you back here on set soon Jon Hilsenrath Wall Street Journal. We'll be right back with final thoughts from this all-star panel.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Great show today final thoughts, Pete Hegseth real quick.\\n\\nHEGSETH: A real state sandwich or not I'm still going to Dunkin Donuts.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: I'm going to watch that interview with John Podesta, again and again, that's classic and epic thank you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Great show.\\n\\nMCDOWELL: Republicans for single payer think about it.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Think about it.

Real GDP\\ngrew at a 1.4% annual rate in Q1 versus last month\ufffds estimate of 1.2% and the initial\\nreading of 0.7%. The upward revision was mostly due to faster growth in consumer\\nspending on services, with smaller changes, both up and down, scattered among other\\nsectors of the economy. Meanwhile, economy-wide corporate profits were revised\\ndownwardly by 0.4%, and now show a 2.3% decline in Q1 from Q4. In spite of the dip\\nin Q1, profits are still up 3.3% from a year ago. This is in sharp contrast to S&P 500\\nearnings, which were up 14% in Q1 from a year ago. The government estimate of\\neconomy-wide profits was pulled lower by inventory valuations and foreign earnings.\\nWe use these earnings in our stock market models which continue to show the S&P 500\\nas undervalued. In addition, we think this measure of profits will turn upward in the\\nquarters ahead. Moreover, an unusually large reduction in the value of inventories was\\nalso a headwind in Q1. But, in spite of the dip in Q1, profits are still up 3.3% from a\\nyear ago. In terms of monetary policy, nothing in today\ufffds report suggests we should\\nchange our forecast that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again in September and start\\nreducing its balance sheet on October 1. Nominal GDP _ real GDP growth plus\\ninflation _ grew at a 3.4% annual rate, the same pace as the average of the past two\\nyears, easily outpacing a short-term interest rate target of 1.00% to 1.25%. In other\\nnews this morning, initial jobless claims rose 2,000 to 244,000. Continuing claims rose\\n6,000 to 1.95 million. These figures suggest job creation of about 200,000 for June. In other recent news, the Richmond Fed index, a\\nmeasure of mid-Atlantic factory sentiment, rose to +7 in June from +1 in May. On the housing front, the national Case-Shiller home\\nprice index rose 0.2% in April and is up 5.5% from a year ago, an acceleration from the 5.1% gain in the year ending in April 2016.\\nPending home sales, which are contracts on existing homes, slipped 0.8% in May after declining 1.7% in April.

GDP is also equal to the sum of personal\\nconsumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and\\ngovernment consumption expenditures and gross investment.\\n\\nGross domestic income (GDI) is the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP.\\nIn national economic accounting, GDP and GDI are conceptually equal. In practice, GDP and GDI differ\\nbecause they are constructed using largely independent source data. Real GDI is calculated by deflating\\ngross domestic income using the GDP price index as the deflator, and is therefore conceptually\\nequivalent to real GDP.\\n\\nCurrent-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred\ufffdthat is,\\nat \ufffdmarket value.\ufffd Also referred to as \ufffdnominal estimates\ufffd or as \ufffdcurrent-price estimates.\ufffd\\nReal values are inflation-adjusted estimates\ufffdthat is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.\\nThe gross domestic purchases price index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by\\nU.S. residents.\\n\\nThe personal consumption expenditure price index measures the prices paid for the goods and services\\npurchased by, or on the behalf of, \ufffdpersons.\ufffd\\n\\nProfits from current production, referred to as corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment\\n(IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) in the NIPAs, is a measure of the net income of\\ncorporations before deducting income taxes that is consistent with the value of goods and services\\nmeasured in GDP. The IVA and CCAdj are adjustments that convert inventory withdrawals and\\ndepreciation of fixed assets reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost economic\\nmeasures used in the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nFor more definitions, see the Glossary: National Income and Product Accounts.\\n\\n\\nStatistical conventions\\n\\nAnnual rates. Quarterly values are expressed at seasonally-adjusted annual rates (SAAR), unless\\notherwise specified. Dollar changes are calculated as the difference between these SAAR values. For\\ndetail, see the FAQ \ufffdWhy does BEA publish estimates at annual rates?\ufffd\\n\\nPercent changes in quarterly series are calculated from unrounded data and are displayed at annual\\nrates, unless otherwise specified. For details, see the FAQ \ufffdHow is average annual growth calculated?\ufffd\\n\\nQuantities and prices. Quantities, or \ufffdreal\ufffd volume measures, and prices are expressed as index\\nnumbers with a specified reference year equal to 100 (currently 2009). Quantity and price indexes are\\ncalculated using a Fisher-chained weighted formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent\\nperiods (quarters for quarterly data and annuals for annual data). \ufffdReal\ufffd dollar series are calculated by\\nmultiplying the published quantity index by the current dollar value in the reference year (2009) and\\nthen dividing by 100. Percent changes calculated from real quantity indexes and chained-dollar levels\\nare conceptually the same; any differences are due to rounding.\\n\\nChained-dollar values are not additive because the relative weights for a given period differ from those\\nof the reference year. In tables that display chained-dollar values, a \ufffdresidual\ufffd line shows the difference\\nbetween the sum of detailed chained-dollar series and its corresponding aggregate.\\n\\n\\nUpdates to GDP\\n\\nBEA releases three vintages of the current quarterly estimate for GDP:  \\Advance\\ estimates are\\nreleased near the end of the first month following the end of the quarter and are based on source data\\nthat are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency; \ufffdsecond\ufffd and \ufffdthird\ufffd estimates\\nare released near the end of the second and third months, respectively, and are based on more detailed\\nand more comprehensive data as they become available.\\n\\nAnnual and comprehensive updates are typically released in late July. Annual updates generally cover at\\nleast the 3 most recent calendar years (and their associated quarters) and incorporate newly available\\nmajor annual source data as well as some changes in methods and definitions to improve the accounts.\\nComprehensive (or benchmark) updates are carried out at about 5-year intervals and incorporate major\\nperiodic source data, as well as major conceptual improvements.\\nThe table below shows the average revisions to the quarterly percent changes in real GDP between\\ndifferent estimate vintages, without regard to sign.\\n\\nVintage                               Average Revision Without Regard to Sign\\n                                         (percentage points, annual rates)\\nAdvance to second                                     0.5\\nAdvance to third                                      0.6\\nSecond to third                                       0.2\\nAdvance to latest                                     1.1\\nNote - Based on estimates from 1993 through 2015.

Economists expected the data to be unrevised today, but the best news came in the details.\\n\\nThe factors behind the upward adjustment were a significant upgrade to personal consumption expenditures (PCE or consumer spending) and to export growth. PCE was adjusted to show an increase of 1.1% versus the 0.6% increase previously reported. We note that consumer spending was still relatively soft in the quarter, marking a four-year low, though that was better than the seven-year low at the last reading.\\n\\nConsumer spending (NYSEARCA:XLY) drives the U.S. economy (NYSEARCA:DIA) and has been a point of concern for investors.

The increase stemmed largely from better consumer spending and export data in this revision. Personal consumption expenditures rose 1.1 percent at the annual rate in the first quarter, which was an improvement from the prior estimate of 0.6 percent but still weaker than desired. Durable goods spending declined 1.6 percent in this report, pulled lower by a sharp decrease in motor vehicles and parts. Nonetheless, consumer spending added 0.75 percentage points to headline GDP growth, up from 0.44 percent in the estimate released last month.\\nAt the same time, goods exports increased 10.5 percent at the annual rate, an improvement from the 8.4 percent gain in the prior report. In addition, the decline in goods imports shifted from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent in this release. As a result, the contribution to GDP growth from net exports rose from 0.13 percent in the earlier estimate to 0.23 percent. After a large drag on growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 from net exports, this was a sign that international activity had stabilized somewhat in the early months of 2017.\\nMeanwhile, business spending pulled back slightly, even as that category remained a bright spot in the first quarter data. Nonresidential fixed investment slipped from an annualized 11.4 percent gain in the prior report to a still healthy 10.4 percent increase in this release. It added 1.23 percentage points to top-line real GDP growth, boosted by strong jumps in spending on equipment and structures. The increase in nonresidential investment in structures, for instance, was the best in three years. Moreover, residential investment also saw healthy gains in the first quarter, increasing an annualized 13.0 percent and adding 0.48 percent to GDP growth.\\nIn contrast to those measures, reduced spending on inventories subtracted 1.11 percentage points from real GDP\ufffdits largest drag. The silver lining is that better spending on inventories in the second quarter should help to propel a rebound in growth. Finally, government spending subtracted 0.16 percentage points from headline growth, ending two quarters of positive contributions, with reduced spending at all levels.\\nOverall, we traditionally have a sluggish first quarter followed by a strong rebound in the second quarter. My current forecast is for at least 3.0 percent growth in real GDP in the second quarter, with the economy expanding 2.3 percent for 2017 as a whole. Of course, these estimates might drift higher with passage of more pro-growth policies, especially in terms of the outlook later this year and into 2018.": 1, "The Commerce Department has released the third--and final--estimate of the GDP growth for the first quarter and the US clocks in at 1.4%. This is a less than startling growth in an economy apparently running at full employment, with artificially low interest rates and with really no major seeming problem nor impediment. We've low commodity prices, oil's very calm indeed, there's no great inflation to speak of out there, we've several new technologies to apply. So, why is growth so meager?\\n\\nI tend to think that's we've two problems here. One is that growth is happening in areas where GDP just isn't a good measure of it. As Google's Hal Varian points out, GDP doesn't deal well with free. And it's entirely obvious that Facebook and Google's various offerings add value to our lives but we're simply not recording that properly. We're getting the ad spend on them, that's included, but we're not capturing the consumer surplus at all. And remarkably, the effect of WhatsApp on the national economic numbers is that it reduces recorded productivity. Which is entirely insane, that 200 people providing telecoms to 800 million others are listed as reducing productivity.\\n\\nSo we know that we've a large measurement problem. But I also tend to think that we've got a small one as well:\\n\\nThe U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a jump in exports, beating expectations and providing a slightly more encouraging outlook for growth this year.  That's OK, but it's still at that relatively low level:\\n\\nAnalysts estimate the U.S. economy will grow at a 3 percent rate in the April-to-June period, though the slowdown in equipment orders and shipments reported earlier this week raises the risk that business investment will provide less of a boost than anticipated.\\n\\nA bounce from 1.4% to 3% in successive quarters? I'm really not sure that the world works that way: The Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter \ufffd better than a previous estimate of 1.2 percent and double the initial estimate of 0.7 percent. The upgrade reflects new-found strength in consumer spending and exports.\\n\\nTo explain how estimates can vary so much. Commerce issues those three different estimates, the first based on an awful lot of estimates of estimates. The second has firmer figures in it, the third, today's, is as far as possible based upon real numbers extracted from the economy. We're still going to have to wait for the final, final, number but that's a long way away. We need to get, for example, the depreciation numbers and those tend to come from corporate accounts--we might be a year away from the truly final number.\\n\\nHowever, from Commerce, this chart shows what I'm worrying about: As I've pointed out before we know very well that the economy varies much more than this over short periods of time. December has a burst of hiring for the holiday shopping season, Amazon warehouses and bricks and mortar stores alike hire droves--as does USPS if it's anything like the Royal Mail. All of whom are then laid off come Jan 1 of course. But we know that these events are going to happen every year and they're not what we're interested in at all. For what we want to know is what is the trend of the economy, not what are the known seasonal variations. Thus we make seasonal corrections. We try to strip out those things we know happen every year at the same time so that we do indeed get the trend, not the holiday hiring.\\n\\nWhich is where I suspect we've a problem. For we really don't think that the trend of the economy bounces from 1.4% to 3%, quarter on quarter. My suspicion is therefore that there's something happening in the winter or early spring each year that we're not accounting for properly. Actually, so do the eggheads at Commerce, it's just that no one really knows quite what it is at present. Once they find it, they'll correct for it, and we should see rather less quarterly variance in these GDP numbers.": 1, "The Commerce Department today upwardly revised its estimate of gross domestic product growth for the first quarter of 2017 from 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent on stronger consumer spending and exports.

Our projection over the 10-year period is actually 2.9 percent, which I think is quite conservative, scaling up to 3 and staying there, which I think both the President and I believe we can do better than 3 percent.

GDP is also equal to the sum of personal\\nconsumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and\\ngovernment consumption expenditures and gross investment.\\n\\nGross domestic income (GDI) is the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP.\\nIn national economic accounting, GDP and GDI are conceptually equal. In practice, GDP and GDI differ\\nbecause they are constructed using largely independent source data. Real GDI is calculated by deflating\\ngross domestic income using the GDP price index as the deflator, and is therefore conceptually\\nequivalent to real GDP.\\n\\nCurrent-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred\ufffdthat is,\\nat \ufffdmarket value.\ufffd Also referred to as \ufffdnominal estimates\ufffd or as \ufffdcurrent-price estimates.\ufffd\\nReal values are inflation-adjusted estimates\ufffdthat is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.\\nThe gross domestic purchases price index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by\\nU.S. residents.\\n\\nThe personal consumption expenditure price index measures the prices paid for the goods and services\\npurchased by, or on the behalf of, \ufffdpersons.\ufffd\\n\\nProfits from current production, referred to as corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment\\n(IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) in the NIPAs, is a measure of the net income of\\ncorporations before deducting income taxes that is consistent with the value of goods and services\\nmeasured in GDP. The IVA and CCAdj are adjustments that convert inventory withdrawals and\\ndepreciation of fixed assets reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost economic\\nmeasures used in the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nFor more definitions, see the Glossary: National Income and Product Accounts.\\n\\n\\nStatistical conventions\\n\\nAnnual rates. Quarterly values are expressed at seasonally-adjusted annual rates (SAAR), unless\\notherwise specified. Dollar changes are calculated as the difference between these SAAR values. For\\ndetail, see the FAQ \ufffdWhy does BEA publish estimates at annual rates?\ufffd\\n\\nPercent changes in quarterly series are calculated from unrounded data and are displayed at annual\\nrates, unless otherwise specified. For details, see the FAQ \ufffdHow is average annual growth calculated?\ufffd\\n\\nQuantities and prices. Quantities, or \ufffdreal\ufffd volume measures, and prices are expressed as index\\nnumbers with a specified reference year equal to 100 (currently 2009). Quantity and price indexes are\\ncalculated using a Fisher-chained weighted formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent\\nperiods (quarters for quarterly data and annuals for annual data). \ufffdReal\ufffd dollar series are calculated by\\nmultiplying the published quantity index by the current dollar value in the reference year (2009) and\\nthen dividing by 100. Percent changes calculated from real quantity indexes and chained-dollar levels\\nare conceptually the same; any differences are due to rounding.\\n\\nChained-dollar values are not additive because the relative weights for a given period differ from those\\nof the reference year. In tables that display chained-dollar values, a \ufffdresidual\ufffd line shows the difference\\nbetween the sum of detailed chained-dollar series and its corresponding aggregate.\\n\\n\\nUpdates to GDP\\n\\nBEA releases three vintages of the current quarterly estimate for GDP:  \\Advance\\ estimates are\\nreleased near the end of the first month following the end of the quarter and are based on source data\\nthat are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency; \ufffdsecond\ufffd and \ufffdthird\ufffd estimates\\nare released near the end of the second and third months, respectively, and are based on more detailed\\nand more comprehensive data as they become available.\\n\\nAnnual and comprehensive updates are typically released in late July.

In the fourth quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 4.2 percent, or $194.1 billion (table 1 and\\ntable 3).\\n\\nThe price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with\\nan increase of 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter (table 4). The PCE price index increased 2.4 percent,\\ncompared with an increase of 2.0 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index\\nincreased 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 1.3 percent (appendix table A).\\n\\n\\nUpdates to GDP\\n\\nThe upward revision to the percent change in real GDP primarily reflected upward revisions to PCE and\\nto exports which were partly offset by a downward revision to nonresidential fixed investment.

GDP is also equal to the sum of personal\\nconsumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and\\ngovernment consumption expenditures and gross investment.\\n\\nGross domestic income (GDI) is the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP.\\nIn national economic accounting, GDP and GDI are conceptually equal. In practice, GDP and GDI differ\\nbecause they are constructed using largely independent source data. Real GDI is calculated by deflating\\ngross domestic income using the GDP price index as the deflator, and is therefore conceptually\\nequivalent to real GDP.\\n\\nCurrent-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred\ufffdthat is,\\nat \ufffdmarket value.\ufffd Also referred to as \ufffdnominal estimates\ufffd or as \ufffdcurrent-price estimates.\ufffd\\nReal values are inflation-adjusted estimates\ufffdthat is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.\\nThe gross domestic purchases price index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by\\nU.S. residents.\\n\\nThe personal consumption expenditure price index measures the prices paid for the goods and services\\npurchased by, or on the behalf of, \ufffdpersons.\ufffd\\n\\nProfits from current production, referred to as corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment\\n(IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCAdj) in the NIPAs, is a measure of the net income of\\ncorporations before deducting income taxes that is consistent with the value of goods and services\\nmeasured in GDP. The IVA and CCAdj are adjustments that convert inventory withdrawals and\\ndepreciation of fixed assets reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost economic\\nmeasures used in the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nFor more definitions, see the Glossary: National Income and Product Accounts.\\n\\n\\nStatistical conventions\\n\\nAnnual rates. Quarterly values are expressed at seasonally-adjusted annual rates (SAAR), unless\\notherwise specified. Dollar changes are calculated as the difference between these SAAR values. For\\ndetail, see the FAQ \ufffdWhy does BEA publish estimates at annual rates?\ufffd\\n\\nPercent changes in quarterly series are calculated from unrounded data and are displayed at annual\\nrates, unless otherwise specified. For details, see the FAQ \ufffdHow is average annual growth calculated?\ufffd\\n\\nQuantities and prices. Quantities, or \ufffdreal\ufffd volume measures, and prices are expressed as index\\nnumbers with a specified reference year equal to 100 (currently 2009). Quantity and price indexes are\\ncalculated using a Fisher-chained weighted formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent\\nperiods (quarters for quarterly data and annuals for annual data). \ufffdReal\ufffd dollar series are calculated by\\nmultiplying the published quantity index by the current dollar value in the reference year (2009) and\\nthen dividing by 100. Percent changes calculated from real quantity indexes and chained-dollar levels\\nare conceptually the same; any differences are due to rounding.\\n\\nChained-dollar values are not additive because the relative weights for a given period differ from those\\nof the reference year. In tables that display chained-dollar values, a \ufffdresidual\ufffd line shows the difference\\nbetween the sum of detailed chained-dollar series and its corresponding aggregate.\\n\\n\\nUpdates to GDP\\n\\nBEA releases three vintages of the current quarterly estimate for GDP:  \\Advance\\ estimates are\\nreleased near the end of the first month following the end of the quarter and are based on source data\\nthat are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency; \ufffdsecond\ufffd and \ufffdthird\ufffd estimates\\nare released near the end of the second and third months, respectively, and are based on more detailed\\nand more comprehensive data as they become available.\\n\\nAnnual and comprehensive updates are typically released in late July. Annual updates generally cover at\\nleast the 3 most recent calendar years (and their associated quarters) and incorporate newly available\\nmajor annual source data as well as some changes in methods and definitions to improve the accounts.\\nComprehensive (or benchmark) updates are carried out at about 5-year intervals and incorporate major\\nperiodic source data, as well as major conceptual improvements.\\nThe table below shows the average revisions to the quarterly percent changes in real GDP between\\ndifferent estimate vintages, without regard to sign.\\n\\nVintage                               Average Revision Without Regard to Sign\\n                                         (percentage points, annual rates)\\nAdvance to second                                     0.5\\nAdvance to third                                      0.6\\nSecond to third                                       0.2\\nAdvance to latest                                     1.1\\nNote - Based on estimates from 1993 through 2015. For more information on GDP updates, see Revision\\nInformation on the BEA Web site.\\n\\nThe larger average revision from the advance to the latest estimate reflects the fact that periodic\\ncomprehensive updates include major statistical and methodological improvements.\\n\\nUnlike GDP, an advance current quarterly estimate of GDI is not released because data on domestic\\nprofits and on net interest of domestic industries are not available.
