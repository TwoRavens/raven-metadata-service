Probably because they give enormous tax breaks to the rich to make them richer while taking away from every one else to pay for it.": 1, "Even though we are making a progress, the rate of economic growth is just took slow.  We need to do something to jump start the economy. The slow growth of 1.6\\% is not acceptable. Democrat should outline their economic agenda that would help the country.

I don't really care about the economy, at least, not in statistics and numbers.": 1, "Growth of the economy has indeed slowed, but not by as much as had first been predicted. Despite that, though, growth rate in general is slower than the previous year and expected growth is unchanged. Also, the President's goal of 3\\% growth still seems unreachable.": 1, "Hey, I didn't realize the Republican party was doing so well this term!": 1, "Honestly, it was not easy to read the article I just read. At first, I thought the article was saying that there was an increase in the economy due to consumer purchasing and exports, but further down the article, it started to state that other consumer spending was at a low and corporate profits had dropped. So, I guess the economy is growing in some areas and suffering in others.": 1, "I acknowledge the relative strength of the economy so far during the Trump administration.": 1, "I believe the eocnomy will turn around greatly. I believe our goal of 3.0 percent is viable. It may take a little time, but with this administration I believe our economy will grow rapidly. ": 1, "I bring up the point in the article where it states, that President Donald Trump's plans to help the economy has yet to provide any substantial help since he has taken office. I would also mention that the US economy has not slowed as much as predicted because of higher consumer spending.": 1, "I can't believe trump is trying to hold on to unbelievable and unsubstantiated claims on the economy.  The data shows how it is responding to Obama's policies coupled with his election.  All his bluster and hot air cannot change the data.": 1, "I don't think there is much to say. Trump has not yet achieved his goals and it is probably too early to determine how Trump's policies will affect the economy. There isn't really much this article has to do with Trump in the first place, besides mentioning that his policies are not yet implemented.": 1, "I feel like the economy is on an uptick. Although President Trump has not been able to meet his agenda as he wanted, the economy is doing better. ": 1, "I feel that reducing costs can be a good thing. I feel this is leading down the right path.": 1, "I feel the presidents agenda is not being implemented. Nothing he promised is happening because all there is is constant controversy.": 1, "I find it troubling that we live in these time's. I think some thing should change immediately. ": 1, "I have doubts that Trump's economic forecast will come to pass. Our economy needs a boost, but I don't see a plan that will raise it by 3\\%.": 1, "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1, "I just read an article abotu the current economy. The economy isn't great yet but is better than expected. It certainly will be nice when it gets back to where it was in the nineties.": 1, "I just read an article in which Trump administration revise their report to make it look like our economy is doing great. Trump policy hasn't even get off the ground and they're reporting that our economy is gaining this much.": 1, "I just read an article on the revised numbers of GDP for the last quarter. All Icould get out of it was that it wasn;t as bad as they initially thoought. Beyond that, I could notget anything out the articale. It felt like I was reading mumbo jumbo. ": 1, "I just read an article saying that economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter of the year. However, it is still on the low side compared to recent years, and far short of the BS projection of the current regime in Washington. I guess it's going to take a little while for 45's administration to blunder into financial disaster for the country, but I have every confidence that they will do so, alas.": 1, "I just read an article that I barely understand. It said something about the US economy has slowed a lot. It also said that the Trump administration's plan of boosting the US economy to 3 percent was something that would be tough to do and that it has not been 3 percent since the 90s. Most of it was technical mumbo-jumbo but it said the US economy was bad.": 1, "I just read an article that seemed to indicate the economy is doing a little better than expected and it's giving me a little hope about the future.": 1, "I just read an economic article which states that the GDP growth in the first quarter was actually higher than initial estimates projected.  Consumer spending was higher than predicted and this could be a result of the president's policies although they are still getting off the ground.  It's not as good as it was in the 90's but still I think the economy is heading in the right direction.": 1, "I just read an interesting news article about the economy. It seems that they've been seeing some expansion in most sectors, albeit by just a little. I wonder if this means that corporations simply have more faith in Trump as president?": 1, "I read an article that basically said the eocnomy is still growing, albeit slower than before. The 3\\% increase the Trump administration has been aiming for hasn't been seen since the 90's, but it has still been steadily climbing since around the year 2000.": 1, "I read that in the macro sense, economic growth in the country overall is still relatively slow, but not as bad as was forecast. ": 1, "I read that the economy isn't growing as much as it did last year. The 1st quarter was one of the slowest in recent history.": 1, "I read that us gross domestic product had increased in the last few months. Eventhough there was initial increase in economy under Trumps administration now it has been suffering to keep up with the expected growth.": 1, "I read this article that was trying to portray President Trump in a poor light. It stated tha the has yet to get his financial plan off the ground 5 months into his presidency. It is so ridiculous how th emedi alike to spin everything instead of reporting unbiased facts. President Trump is much more financially responsible than the last several presidents.": 1, "I recently read that since the year 2000 our economy has grown at a 2 percent rate every year. Trump is hoping to raise that to 3 percent. The growth of our economy has slowed down. ": 1, "I saw that they revised first quarter GDP growth up a couple of ticks.": 1, "I see that we are not meeting the rates that were expected and we are being hit with losses and I don't know what to expect in this world. I don't understand everything, but I saw lose and no expectations met. I do not understand government and what is happening or why this is happening.": 1, "I think both parties need to work together to fix the economy. The stats in the article indicate that growth is slow or next to none, and that there needs to be change.": 1, "I think if you want spending to increase, there would have to be more help for the middle class. We can't spend more if we're barely scraping by to pay our bills. ": 1, "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy o rnot. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1, "I think the economy and the state of the union is kind of up in the air. People are trying to get a handle on where we are heading. I do feel positive about the direction we're going and if we continue on this path it will be positive for all of us.": 1, "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1, "I'd say Trump is being effective with his plan but it needs more time to fully work out the way he intends it to work.": 1, "I'm not sure about the article. It seemed to emphasize negative aspects of an uptick in growth. I get that the growth numbers seem beind the goal of 3\\%. It takes time to change, but wonder if 3\\% might be too ambitious. still it's growing and I don't understand the \\down\\ emphasis of the article.": 1, "I've heard that Donald Trump has actually had an increase in GDP growth. It looks like businesses are on the right track in gaining profits. What are your thoughts on that?": 1, "I've read a really interesting article the other day. Did you know that gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 annual rate instead of 1.2 last month? It is still the slowest growth rate but during January - march it tends to under perform. Also, president donald trump's economic program of tax cuts still hasn't been done, despite him being in office for five months. What's the problem?": 1, "Im surprised about how tremendously well the economy is starting to improve in the U.S. Even if it is getting better slowly is still a positive aspect. Hopefully it will continue and open up more opportunities and resources required for people to live more successful lives. ": 1, "In general the first quarter of this year was a disappointment not meeting target levels set by President Trump.": 1, "In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and exports performed much better than expected. The country is on the right track under Trump and this can be seen in the optimism shown by both consumers and businesses. People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possibel for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1, "Instead of the 1.2 percent increase that usually occurs, there was a 1.4 increase this past month.": 1, "It appears like the economy did better than expected. However it was not by much. Still in teh category of the slowest growth in quite some time.": 1, "It appears the Trump administration is having a hard time implementing all the policies and things he said he would. It must be very disappointing to you as Republican especially since it is Republican controlled congress as well! Republicans have the presidency and control both houses of congress and they still can't even come up with something to repeal and replace Obama Care Affordable Care Act let alone fix the economy! Must be very discouraging indeed.": 1, "It appears, based on the article, that our country's economic growth has somewhat improved rather than the forecasts have predicted would occur.": 1, "It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the Trump administration economic policies 5 months into his administration. There are a great deal of numbers that give conflicting accounts of the current economy but the bottom line is the economy is growing, exports are increasing, inventories are down and the unemployment rate is staying consistent. IT will be interesting if \\America First\\ works when looked at over a reasonable amount of time.": 1, "It looks as though the economy is doing fairly well. Consumer spending is up and this is driving the upswing in other things. Jobs are on the rise by a small rise. Businesses are seeing tax relief which allows them to hire.": 1, "It looks like our current president has been doing good things for the economy lately.": 1, "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing a little better than expected, but less well than hoped. I guess maybe it'll continue to go up?": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing better than previously thought. As a nation we are reporting better than we are. I would recommend evaluating what is causing the increase to the GDP and see if we can boost these items further.": 1, "It seems as though the economy is not recovering at a very quick rate. The 1990s saw the best growth years. Predictions about growth have been wrong also, we are behind what the predictions have said would happen.": 1, "It seems fairly obvious that for all of Trumps promises, the economy is continuing to stagnate, and there is very little growth happening.": 1, "It seems like the economy is doing alright, it is not growing as quick as it had, but at least it is headed in the right direction.": 1, "It seems like the economy is no longer stable. One minute the economy is doing great but then data reflects that is TRULY not!  I wish Obama was back in office. At least we saw great improvements with the economy since his early presidency. By the way this article stated the economy has been bad since 2000 I beg to differ!!": 1, "It seems like the economy is slowly gaining ground, but it will be interesting to see how the new policies that President Trump is trying to enact will affect the economy.": 1, "It seems like the eocnomic numbers are verymixed. But, I still don't think Trump can take any credit for the positive things that came out of it as his policies have not really been implemented.": 1, "It seems that consumer confidence has been up since Trump won. And that's even with the Democrats trying to dampen economic growth by slowing Trump down in his tax plan. Imagine how it will be onece it is passed.": 1, "It seems that earnings in spending and similar transactions are better than slightly predicted and trump has nothing to do with it. However values are still some of the lowest we have seen in a while.": 1, "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as PResident Trump predicted, it is still going in a postive direction.": 1, "It seems that the economy is slowly knitting itself back together, no thanks to Trump and the GOP in congress.": 1, "It seems that the spending rate isn't falling as quickly as had been projected. Trumps plan to increase the economy at a 3\\% rate was ambitious to say the least and make note of the fact that his economic plans haven't gotten off the ground even five months into his presidency.": 1, "It takes time to see lasting effects of presidential changes to economic policy.": 1, "It will be interesting to see if the Trump administration can pull off 3\\% GDP growth since the economy has grown 2\\% a year roughly for the past decade.": 1, "It would appear that in the new President's first five months in office he has not been able to fulfill his promises to booth economic growth in the United States. He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1, "It would be nice if we could get tax reform done this year, it's nice to see somebody making some kind of effort to rollback the encroachment of the adnimistrative state and reign in excessive regulation by un-elected bureaucrats, and I'm hopeful the two major parties can find a way to work together on much-needed and over-delayed nationwide infrastructure investments.": 1, "It's shocking that the percentage is higher than expected, but it's still tough that overall it is a low number. The president is pushing his luck wanting 3 percent.": 1, "Its a ever changing thing when it comes to the stock market.": 1, "Its been 5 months since the new President's presidency and his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending has not made an impact.": 1, "Its surprising that growth has been such a challenge. And profits fell after tax in teh first quarter after rising the last 3 months.": 1, "Looking at this article it is proof that the economy is growing under the current Republican administration. It is growing a bit slower than expected, but that might look to change. It's still going to be difficult to reach a 3 percent yearly growth..": 1, "Looks like we should have voted with you, for Hillary Clinton.  Our man Trump is not living up to his promises.  He said 3 percent growth, but nope.": 1, "Love or hate Trump, you can't argue with the performance of the economy since he's taken over. The GDP doesn't lie and it's way up as is consumer spending. I don't like the guy, but Republican/conservative methods are proven.": 1, "Most economic aspects of the country are improving, at least slightly. The targeted growth rate of 3\\% yearly is challenging, but there's some growth.": 1, "Most of this is carryover from the Obama administration, we're still too early to tell what sort of impact Trump's economic policies will have.": 1, "National gross domestic product has grown by only 1.1-1.4 percent in the first quarter which is pretty low even though trump and his administration were hoping to get it to grow by 3\\% compared to last year.": 1, "Obama's economy continues to chug along but Trump's inaction is slowly causing damage.": 1, "Our country is in danger, nothing is being done. The numbers aren't even accurate!": 1, "Our current president has not made any issues or passed any bills so far and the GDP is lower than expected, although it was higher from Jan. to march, but then dropped off.": 1, "Our economy has been slowly grinding higher even though the policies that Trump plans to bring into action have not materialized yet.": 1, "Our economy has come to a crawl, but it is growing. Trump is still trying to get his tax cuts and the like off the ground.": 1, "Our economy is doing fairly well. We are growing as a country and we are selling more products. The growth will help with jobs and the economy.": 1, "Our economy is getting weaker everyday. President Trump has offer false hope to everyone who voted for him. He has failed as a president. You can' tpromise to do something and not do it. It is his fault tha tour economy is dwindling.": 1, "Our economy isn't doing as well as we hoped it would under the new administration.": 1, "Our economy this quarter increased by 1.4 and it was predicted to be 1.2. It is still a slow growth compare last year but it still a good news.": 1, "Our main goal is to advance our country and communitites to have a better life for their amilies and not have to work like slaves. Under the current administration, our sales are dropping our cousin living is rising, we are feeling and many parts in the and ministration that we need to advance our country. Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us. I don't care who you are, for the love of God there needs to be an impeachment.": 1, "Our president needs to do a way better job. Stuff needs to get done. Our economy should be going up.": 1, "Overall, Trump's aim to increase the GDP growth to 3\\% is getting off to a very slow start.  He has not been able to implement any of his tax cuts that aim to help increase growth.  The GDP growth rate is now at 1.4\\% compared to 1.2\\% in previous months.  There appears to be more spending by businesses and consumers, but this is not getting us to the 3\\% GDP growth that Trump is aiming for.": 1, "President Trump had made plans of the cutting of spending in several different areas to increase GDP growth overall. The growth had been successful at 1.4\\% but is noted that it is one of the slowest growths to occur.": 1, "President Trump is already doing a good job helping the economy improve. While it still has a long way to go to get to a 3\\% growth, the economy actually did better in Q1 of 2017 than analysts first determined.": 1, "Promises made by the president during his campaign have not come through at all. Not one bit of legislation has gone through the Republican legislature. Obviously republicans are great and complaining and broken promises but are a do nothing party when in power.": 1, "Recent GDP growth has exceeded projections but still remains very low at an annual rate of 1.4\\%. This is still pretty far off of the target of 3\\% that the current administration is targeting.": 1, "Republicans cannot not even be successful with their new president with getting a clear budget cut done.": 1, "Seems like the economy is slowly starting to come back, despite all the bull- - - - politics.": 1, "Seems like your boy Trump isn't living up to all of his promises, huh?  We're not at that 3% he promised and it's not looking likely that we will be.": 1, "Since the year started, our nation has earned 1.4\\% than our total worth so far. That is called GDP. We are making good pace and making lots of money.": 1, "So far there have not been very much change in a good way since Donald Trump became presidnet. Companies have spend more and the numbers from the article do not look good. ": 1, "So the US economy is not as bad off as first thought. It's close but grew at a slightly better rate then. It's under the presidential estimate however. Also hey did you know consumer spending is 2/3's of the economy?": 1, "Some reported data about the economy seems to indicate that things are improving. ": 1, "The article discussed the GDP. The economy slowed less sharply than estimated because of consumer spending. However it was still a slow growth rate.": 1, "The article I read stated that GDP was still fairly low for the first quarter of 2017, and has not gotten up to 3\\% as offered by the Trump administration. However forecasters estimate teh 2nd quarter GDP to be 2.9\\%. Retail sales figures slumped in teh first quarter of 2017 and there are cyclical factors in teh governments' analysis that causes the first quarter GDP to always be a little deflated compared to other quarters of the year. ": 1, "The article is stating that there is growth, but it is small and there is a decline in the slowing down of the GDP. Even though the President is having trouble getting some programs off the ground There has been some growth. There has been an increase in consumer spending and exporting of goods.": 1, "The article really goes to show how slowly our economy is growing annually. At a 1.4 percent, it is only sightly higher above the 1.2 normal growth usually experienced. This tells us that whatever we are doing right now does not work. Our economy needs to go back to the 90's era where the growth was at a 3 percent rate.": 1, "The article reveals that the standard economic statistics are doing slightly better than expcted, but that the economy, judged be these standards is still not back to where it was some years ago. It is not clear how well Turmp's program is doing with regards to the economy. Personally I am not sure how much thesen umbers reflect underlying reality.": 1, "The article said our economic situation is good just not as good as we were promised.": 1, "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others. Seriously, considering the turmoil the country has been in over the course of the past 5 months it's surprising the economy is doing as well as it is.": 1, "The article stated that we are doing better than what originally was predicted in terms of the national economy.": 1, "The article states that the economy is not improving and has been stagnant over a large number of years.": 1, "The article talked about the growth of the economy. The economy is growing. It is not at target set by the government. Policies are slowly taking in effect.": 1, "The article talkeda bout economic growth and since Trump took office things are not as rosy as predicted. The GDP increased a bit more than expected due to consumer spending. Trumps promises of cuts and economic promises have yet to get off the ground, clearly written by a liberal. Also business spending was up.": 1, "The data is conflicting because there are both tentatively positive results withs omewhat negative results, so it's a mixed bag. There are things the current administration have set as goals which not only are not realized but may in fact be unrealistic: the drive for 3\\% is ridiculous in the light that such a thing hasn't been seen since the 90's and even then it was lower. That was 30 years ago.": 1, "The decrease in the economy. The average of 3\\% growth hasn't been seen since the 1990's. I was upset to hear this and it needs to change and more opportunities need to become available for the American people and stop relying so much on outside sources.": 1, "The econ is getting better and rising slowly.": 1, "The economic growth has not risen as expected. Trumps plans have all not taken effect yet after 5 months into his presidency.": 1, "The economic growth in US in first quarte rof this year was higher then expected but still way lower than 3\\%. 3 \\% is what new President said will happen. Last time we saw numbers around 3\\% was in 1990.": 1, "The economic growth our wonderful president promised us and is fighting hard for isnt coming as fast as the rate is was supposed to have grown.": 1, "THE ECONOMICAL FORECAST YOUR PARTY RELEASED WAS WRONG.": 1, "The economy continues to grow slightly better than expected, but slower than in recent quarters.  Consumer spending increase drove the higher than expected growth.  It continues to be unlikely that the annualized growth will be the 3\\% that Trump had promised.": 1, "The economy did better than was projected. We had a 1.4\\% increase when a 1.2\\% increase was expected. Trump wants a 3\\% increase which hasn't happened since 1990. With his tax cuts and infrastructure spending, he might get there.": 1, "The economy grew 1.6\\% last quarter.": 1, "The economy grew at a slightly faster rate than expected last quarter but it is still rather slow. It is going to be hard to get back to 3\\% growth.": 1, "The economy had only modest growth in this year's first quarter. President Trump has not put into effect most of the ideas he had to spur economic growth, such as infrastructure improvement, deregulation, etc.": 1, "The economy handed to Trump by Obama was in poor shape. Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit. Blaming Trump for the current economy is very unfair since he's only been in office a very sthort time but Democrats will say anything to drag him down. Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1, "The economy has been doing so much better since the election of Trump because the stock market has faith in our President for the first time in 8 years. The main stream media does not report on the truth of the matter because they wish the public to not see how well President Trump is doing for our country. They prefer to lie and make people think Trump is failing. The economy,job market, has all improved and it is all because of Trump. If he had lost things would not have improved a bit.": 1, "The Economy has been on a slow climb. President Trump had planned to boost by 3\\% a year but is currently only around half of that right now. His plan has not gotten off the ground in the 5 months he's been in office and we haven't seen an increase of that size since the 1990's. ": 1, "The economy has gotten slightly better since Trump became president, but it hasn't improved as drastically as was predicted. ": 1, "The economy has not improved since Trump took office.  It showed some growth at the beginning of the year but that would be due to actions taken during Obama's term.": 1, "The economy has not performed as expected. Trump's efforts have yet to show any results, and while in some case things are good, such as consumption, other areas fall short of expectations.": 1, "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in teh economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1, "The economy has remained roughly the same since the new administration has taken over. While it has not slowed as much as predicted, it also has not gained as much as promised. There are a wide variety of factors that go into determining the overall growth such as exports, government spending, and sales to name a few.": 1, "The economy has slowed more than was expected in the past quarter.  The government's projections are probably off by about half.": 1, "The economy hasnt been specifically going through a downfall but it certainly has been slowed down im saying in a way of consumption and imports along with exports.": 1, "The economy is boosting in the first quarter under president Trump, but not as much as expected. The economy slowed more than expected due to higher consumer spending and more exports.": 1, "The economy is complex, it's not growing as much as we thought it would, but it is slowly improving. I don't know much about the economy, what I just read was mostly gibberish to me personally. It just goes right over my head.": 1, "The economy is currently at it's slowest for quite some time.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected per the GDP measure. Consumer spending and exports were higher than predicted. The economy's rate of expansion has been relatively low, so this may be a suggestion of that changing.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected. I think it's because the expectations of tax cuts that will drive spending.": 1, "The economy is doing better than those who think of these things, thought it would. I surprise, especially exports and such being up. Lots of trade with other countries, even during the current administration.": 1, "The economy is doing marginally better than initially thought. But we are still way to dependent on consuming.": 1, "The economy is doing resonably well. there is some weakness in retail and manufacturing, but that has a lot to do with long term secular (vs cyclical shifts) in the economy. the improvement qtr over qtr is minor but things are basically moving along as they have been over the past few years.": 1, "The economy is doing slightly better in the most recent quarter than it was previously, but it's going to be difficult to reach Trump's goal of 3\\% growth.

There is more consumer spending, but the goal of 3\\% growth rate seems entirely unlikely.": 1, "The economy is growing at a sluggish pace, it's nothing fantastic but at the same time it is growing.

He can't do the impossible, and I don't think he would be able to do it.": 1, "To be fully honest I probably wouldn't even mention this article while discussing politics/current events. The connection between federal government and national economics is not so strong as to be a clear political link, especially with a new president (five months in office is not long enough for any of his policies to have taken such an effect they'd move businesses on a massive scale).

I think that it's really too soon to tell how much of this report is due to Trump's performance/influence on the market, and how much might be a hold-over from 2016.  I will be much more interested in seeing his 2nd quarter numbers, and then, down the road, any year-over-year numbers that emerge, as a way of really assessing what Trump's impact on the economy really is.": 1, "Well the economy isn't doing all that well. Rather than the big increases Trump promised growth is still pretty slow.": 1, "Well, I have very little idea what I just read. It seems that the GDP grew at a slightly faster rate than expected but other economic signs are down. Growth is nowhere near what it was in the 1990s, and Trumps plan to raise (something) to 3 percent has not panned out.": 1, "Well, the numbers seem to show that Trump's economic programs are having little if any impact on the actual economy. Growth is at a slower rate than it has been since 2013. The promised infrastructure spending looks like it is not happening, and I doubt it will unless they raise taxes. Reading this report on the actual statistics does not show much progress towards his promised economic growth. Not surprising considering his actions I would say.": 1, "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy. Instead he has been embroiled in controversy after controversy, and his inabilty to control himself for one thing is very unnerving.  He has no previous experience in government and it shows. He is worthless in my opinion.": 1, "While Donald Trump is saying he is the most successful president since Abraham Lincoln in truth his economic plan hasn't even really began nevertheless have any ability to have any outcome yet.

We still have not hit President Trump's target of a 3\\% growth, however, a 1.6\\% increase is making progress.": 1, "You can't always expect a consistent growth rate all of the time. There are going ot be slow times so don't be so worried when teh economy slows down. The government should try to stay out of influencing the economy so that it might improve.": 1, "You have to look at the growth in a few positive ways. If corporations are doing better than they will hire more employees. They will also give better salaries to the employees that they already have. People are able to take care of themselves and their families. This is positive growth and in the few months that Trump has been in office he has done more than the previous President did.": 1, "You have to look at the positive growth. You want more citizens to have good paying jobs and this is the fast way to do it. When companies do well they hire. Simply. This gives money to those employed.": 1, "You know, the most recent reporting on the U.S. economy showed a bit of an improvement owing to some unexpectedly moderate rise in consumer psending \\& a bigger jump in exports. This also included a nice showing on Gross domestic product according to the Commerce Department final assessment on prior first quarter estimates, as Thursday's reporting says. A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate. The Trump administration's stated that it is still expecting a target of swiftly boosting U.S. growth to 3 percent.

Trump is trying to have our taxes, regulations, and infrastructure spending cut. President Trump is trying to get our country in a better place than what Obama left us in.": 1, "You need to start leaning to one side of the spectrum, at least on very specific issues. This article I read clearly indicates that the US economy is showing a nearly standstill growth. This is largely due to the do-nothign Republicans in the house \\& senate.

The stats in the article indicate that growth is slow or next to none, and that there needs to be change.": 1, "I think if you want spending to increase, there would have to be more help for the middle class. We can't spend more if we're barely scraping by to pay our bills. ": 1, "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy or not. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1, "I think the economy and the state of the union is kind of up in the air. People are trying to get a handle on where we are heading. I do feel positive about the direction we're going and if we continue on this path it will be positive for all of us.": 1, "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1, "I'd say Trump is being effective with his plan but it needs more time to fully work out the way he intends it to work.": 1, "I'm not sure about the article. It seemed to emphasize negative aspects of an uptick in growth. I get that the growth numbers seem behind the goal of 3\\%. It takes time to change, but wonder if 3\\% might be too ambitious. still it's growing and I don't understand the \\down\\ emphasis of the article.": 1, "I'm surprised about how tremendously well the economy is starting to improve in the U.S. Even if it is getting better slowly is still a positive aspect. Hopefully it will continue and open up more opportunities and resources required for people to live more successful lives. ": 1, "I've heard that Donald Trump has actually had an increase in GDP growth. It looks like businesses are on the right track in gaining profits. What are your thoughts on that?": 1, "I've read a really interesting article the other day. Did you know that gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 annual rate instead of 1.2 last month? It is still the slowest growth rate but during January - march it tends to under perform. Also, president Donald trump's economic program of tax cuts still hasn't been done, despite him being in office for five months. What's the problem?": 1, "In general the first quarter of this year was a disappointment not meeting target levels set by President Trump.": 1, "In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and exports performed much better than expected. The country is on the right track under Trump and this can be seen in the optimism shown by both consumers and businesses. People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possible for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1, "Instead of the 1.2 percent increase that usually occurs, there was a 1.4 increase this past month.": 1, "It appears like the economy did better than expected. However it was not by much. Still in the category of the slowest growth in quite some time.": 1, "It appears the Trump administration is having a hard time implementing all the policies and things he said he would. It must be very disappointing to you as Republican especially since it is Republican controlled congress as well! Republicans have the presidency and control both houses of congress and they still can't even come up with something to repeal and replace Obama Care Affordable Care Act let alone fix the economy! Must be very discouraging indeed.": 1, "It appears, based on the article, that our country's economic growth has somewhat improved rather than the forecasts have predicted would occur.": 1, "It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the Trump administration economic policies 5 months into his administration. There are a great deal of numbers that give conflicting accounts of the current economy but the bottom line is the economy is growing, exports are increasing, inventories are down and the unemployment rate is staying consistent. IT will be interesting if \\America First\\ works when looked at over a reasonable amount of time.": 1, "It looks as though the economy is doing fairly well. Consumer spending is up and this is driving the upswing in other things. Jobs are on the rise by a small rise. Businesses are seeing tax relief which allows them to hire.": 1, "It looks like our current president has been doing good things for the economy lately.": 1, "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing a little better than expected, but less well than hoped. I guess maybe it'll continue to go up?": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing better than previously thought. As a nation we are reporting better than we are. I would recommend evaluating what is causing the increase to the GDP and see if we can boost these items further.": 1, "It seems as though the economy is not recovering at a very quick rate. The 1990s saw the best growth years. Predictions about growth have been wrong also, we are behind what the predictions have said would happen.": 1, "It seems fairly obvious that for all of Trumps promises, the economy is continuing to stagnate, and there is very little growth happening.": 1, "It seems like the economic numbers are very mixed. But, I still don't think Trump can take any credit for the positive things that came out of it as his policies have not really been implemented.": 1, "It seems like the economy is doing alright, it is not growing as quick as it had, but at least it is headed in the right direction.": 1, "It seems like the economy is no longer stable. One minute the economy is doing great but then data reflects that is TRULY not!  I wish Obama was back in office. At least we saw great improvements with the economy since his early presidency. By the way this article stated the economy has been bad since 2000 I beg to differ!!": 1, "It seems like the economy is slowly gaining ground, but it will be interesting to see how the new policies that President Trump is trying to enact will affect the economy.": 1, "It seems that consumer confidence has been up since Trump won. And that's even with the Democrats trying to dampen economic growth by slowing Trump down in his tax plan. Imagine how it will be once it is passed.": 1, "It seems that earnings in spending and similar transactions are better than slightly predicted and trump has nothing to do with it. However values are still some of the lowest we have seen in a while.": 1, "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as President Trump predicted, it is still going in a positive direction.": 1, "It seems that the economy is slowly knitting itself back together, no thanks to Trump and the GOP in congress.": 1, "It seems that the spending rate isn't falling as quickly as had been projected. Trumps plan to increase the economy at a 3\\% rate was ambitious to say the least and make note of the fact that his economic plans haven't gotten off the ground even five months into his presidency.": 1, "It takes time to see lasting effects of presidential changes to economic policy.": 1, "It will be interesting to see if the Trump administration can pull off 3\\% GDP growth since the economy has grown 2\\% a year roughly for the past decade.": 1, "It would appear that in the new President's first five months in office he has not been able to fulfill his promises to booth economic growth in the United States. He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1, "It would be nice if we could get tax reform done this year, it's nice to see somebody making some kind of effort to rollback the encroachment of the administrative state and reign in excessive regulation by un-elected bureaucrats, and I'm hopeful the two major parties can find a way to work together on much-needed and over-delayed nationwide infrastructure investments.": 1, "It's shocking that the percentage is higher than expected, but it's still tough that overall it is a low number. The president is pushing his luck wanting 3 percent.": 1, "Its a ever changing thing when it comes to the stock market.": 1, "Its been 5 months since the new President's presidency and his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending has not made an impact.": 1, "Its surprising that growth has been such a challenge. And profits fell after tax in the first quarter after rising the last 3 months.": 1, "Looking at this article it is proof that the economy is growing under the current Republican administration. It is growing a bit slower than expected, but that might look to change. It's still going to be difficult to reach a 3 percent yearly growth..": 1, "Looks like we should have voted with you, for Hillary Clinton.  Our man Trump is not living up to his promises.  He said 3 percent growth, but nope.": 1, "Love or hate Trump, you can't argue with the performance of the economy since he's taken over. The GDP doesn't lie and it's way up as is consumer spending. I don't like the guy, but Republican/conservative methods are proven.": 1, "Most economic aspects of the country are improving, at least slightly. The targeted growth rate of 3\\% yearly is challenging, but there's some growth.": 1, "Most of this is carryover from the Obama administration, we're still too early to tell what sort of impact Trump's economic policies will have.": 1, "National gross domestic product has grown by only 1.1-1.4 percent in the first quarter which is pretty low even though trump and his administration were hoping to get it to grow by 3\\% compared to last year.": 1, "Obama's economy continues to chug along but Trump's inaction is slowly causing damage.": 1, "Our country is in danger, nothing is being done. The numbers aren't even accurate!": 1, "Our current president has not made any issues or passed any bills so far and the GDP is lower than expected, although it was higher from Jan. to march, but then dropped off.": 1, "Our economy has been slowly grinding higher even though the policies that Trump plans to bring into action have not materialized yet.": 1, "Our economy has come to a crawl, but it is growing. Trump is still trying to get his tax cuts and the like off the ground.": 1, "Our economy is doing fairly well. We are growing as a country and we are selling more products. The growth will help with jobs and the economy.": 1, "Our economy is getting weaker everyday. President Trump has offer false hope to everyone who voted for him. He has failed as a president. You can't promise to do something and not do it. It is his fault that tour economy is dwindling.": 1, "Our economy isn't doing as well as we hoped it would under the new administration.": 1, "Our economy this quarter increased by 1.4 and it was predicted to be 1.2. It is still a slow growth compare last year but it still a good news.": 1, "Our main goal is to advance our country and communities to have a better life for their families and not have to work like slaves. Under the current administration, our sales are dropping our cousin living is rising, we are feeling and many parts in the and ministration that we need to advance our country. Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us. I don't care who you are, for the love of God there needs to be an impeachment.": 1, "Our president needs to do a way better job. Stuff needs to get done. Our economy should be going up.": 1, "Overall, Trump's aim to increase the GDP growth to 3\\% is getting off to a very slow start.  He has not been able to implement any of his tax cuts that aim to help increase growth.  The GDP growth rate is now at 1.4\\% compared to 1.2\\% in previous months.  There appears to be more spending by businesses and consumers, but this is not getting us to the 3\\% GDP growth that Trump is aiming for.": 1, "President Trump had made plans of the cutting of spending in several different areas to increase GDP growth overall. The growth had been successful at 1.4\\% but is noted that it is one of the slowest growths to occur.": 1, "President Trump is already doing a good job helping the economy improve. While it still has a long way to go to get to a 3\\% growth, the economy actually did better in Q1 of 2017 than analysts first determined.": 1, "Promises made by the president during his campaign have not come through at all. Not one bit of legislation has gone through the Republican legislature. Obviously republicans are great and complaining and broken promises but are a do nothing party when in power.": 1, "Recent GDP growth has exceeded projections but still remains very low at an annual rate of 1.4\\%. This is still pretty far off of the target of 3\\% that the current administration is targeting.": 1, "Republicans cannot not even be successful with their new president with getting a clear budget cut done.": 1, "Seems like the economy is slowly starting to come back, despite all the bull- - - - politics.": 1, "Seems like your boy Trump isn't living up to all of his promises, huh?  We're not at that 3% he promised and it's not looking likely that we will be.": 1, "Since the year started, our nation has earned 1.4\\% than our total worth so far. That is called GDP. We are making good pace and making lots of money.": 1, "So far there have not been very much change in a good way since Donald Trump became president. Companies have spend more and the numbers from the article do not look good. ": 1, "So the US economy is not as bad off as first thought. It's close but grew at a slightly better rate then. It's under the presidential estimate however. Also hey did you know consumer spending is 2/3's of the economy?": 1, "Some reported data about the economy seems to indicate that things are improving. ": 1, "The article discussed the GDP. The economy slowed less sharply than estimated because of consumer spending. However it was still a slow growth rate.": 1, "The article I read stated that GDP was still fairly low for the first quarter of 2017, and has not gotten up to 3\\% as offered by the Trump administration. However forecasters estimate the 2nd quarter GDP to be 2.9\\%. Retail sales figures slumped in the first quarter of 2017 and there are cyclical factors in the governments' analysis that causes the first quarter GDP to always be a little deflated compared to other quarters of the year. ": 1, "The article is stating that there is growth, but it is small and there is a decline in the slowing down of the GDP. Even though the President is having trouble getting some programs off the ground There has been some growth. There has been an increase in consumer spending and exporting of goods.": 1, "The article really goes to show how slowly our economy is growing annually. At a 1.4 percent, it is only slightly higher above the 1.2 normal growth usually experienced. This tells us that whatever we are doing right now does not work. Our economy needs to go back to the 90's era where the growth was at a 3 percent rate.": 1, "The article reveals that the standard economic statistics are doing slightly better than expected, but that the economy, judged be these standards is still not back to where it was some years ago. It is not clear how well Trump's program is doing with regards to the economy. Personally I am not sure how much these numbers reflect underlying reality.": 1, "The article said our economic situation is good just not as good as we were promised.": 1, "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others. Seriously, considering the turmoil the country has been in over the course of the past 5 months it's surprising the economy is doing as well as it is.": 1, "The article stated that we are doing better than what originally was predicted in terms of the national economy.": 1, "The article states that the economy is not improving and has been stagnant over a large number of years.": 1, "The article talked about economic growth and since Trump took office things are not as rosy as predicted. The GDP increased a bit more than expected due to consumer spending. Trumps promises of cuts and economic promises have yet to get off the ground, clearly written by a liberal. Also business spending was up.": 1, "The article talked about the growth of the economy. The economy is growing. It is not at target set by the government. Policies are slowly taking in effect.": 1, "The data is conflicting because there are both tentatively positive results with somewhat negative results, so it's a mixed bag. There are things the current administration have set as goals which not only are not realized but may in fact be unrealistic: the drive for 3\\% is ridiculous in the light that such a thing hasn't been seen since the 90's and even then it was lower. That was 30 years ago.": 1, "The decrease in the economy. The average of 3\\% growth hasn't been seen since the 1990's. I was upset to hear this and it needs to change and more opportunities need to become available for the American people and stop relying so much on outside sources.": 1, "The econ is getting better and rising slowly.": 1, "The economic growth has not risen as expected. Trumps plans have all not taken effect yet after 5 months into his presidency.": 1, "The economic growth in US in first quarter of this year was higher then expected but still way lower than 3\\%. 3 \\% is what new President said will happen. Last time we saw numbers around 3\\% was in 1990.": 1, "The economic growth our wonderful president promised us and is fighting hard for isn't coming as fast as the rate is was supposed to have grown.": 1, "THE ECONOMICAL FORECAST YOUR PARTY RELEASED WAS WRONG.": 1, "The economy continues to grow slightly better than expected, but slower than in recent quarters.  Consumer spending increase drove the higher than expected growth.  It continues to be unlikely that the annualized growth will be the 3\\% that Trump had promised.": 1, "The economy did better than was projected. We had a 1.4\\% increase when a 1.2\\% increase was expected. Trump wants a 3\\% increase which hasn't happened since 1990. With his tax cuts and infrastructure spending, he might get there.": 1, "The economy grew 1.6\\% last quarter.": 1, "The economy grew at a slightly faster rate than expected last quarter but it is still rather slow. It is going to be hard to get back to 3\\% growth.": 1, "The economy had only modest growth in this year's first quarter. President Trump has not put into effect most of the ideas he had to spur economic growth, such as infrastructure improvement, deregulation, etc.": 1, "The economy handed to Trump by Obama was in poor shape. Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit. Blaming Trump for the current economy is very unfair since he's only been in office a very short time but Democrats will say anything to drag him down. Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1, "The economy has been doing so much better since the election of Trump because the stock market has faith in our President for the first time in 8 years. The main stream media does not report on the truth of the matter because they wish the public to not see how well President Trump is doing for our country. They prefer to lie and make people think Trump is failing. The economy, job market, has all improved and it is all because of Trump. If he had lost things would not have improved a bit.": 1, "The Economy has been on a slow climb. President Trump had planned to boost by 3\\% a year but is currently only around half of that right now. His plan has not gotten off the ground in the 5 months he's been in office and we haven't seen an increase of that size since the 1990's. ": 1, "The economy has gotten slightly better since Trump became president, but it hasn't improved as drastically as was predicted. ": 1, "The economy has not improved since Trump took office.  It showed some growth at the beginning of the year but that would be due to actions taken during Obama's term.": 1, "The economy has not performed as expected. Trump's efforts have yet to show any results, and while in some case things are good, such as consumption, other areas fall short of expectations.": 1, "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in the economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1, "The economy has remained roughly the same since the new administration has taken over. While it has not slowed as much as predicted, it also has not gained as much as promised. There are a wide variety of factors that go into determining the overall growth such as exports, government spending, and sales to name a few.": 1, "The economy has slowed more than was expected in the past quarter.  The government's projections are probably off by about half.": 1, "The economy hasn't been specifically going through a downfall but it certainly has been slowed down I'm saying in a way of consumption and imports along with exports.": 1, "The economy is boosting in the first quarter under president Trump, but not as much as expected. The economy slowed more than expected due to higher consumer spending and more exports.": 1, "The economy is complex, it's not growing as much as we thought it would, but it is slowly improving. I don't know much about the economy, what I just read was mostly gibberish to me personally. It just goes right over my head.": 1, "The economy is currently at it's slowest for quite some time.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected per the GDP measure. Consumer spending and exports were higher than predicted. The economy's rate of expansion has been relatively low, so this may be a suggestion of that changing.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected. I think it's because the expectations of tax cuts that will drive spending.": 1, "The economy is doing better than those who think of these things, thought it would. I surprise, especially exports and such being up. Lots of trade with other countries, even during the current administration.": 1, "The economy is doing marginally better than initially thought. But we are still way to dependent on consuming.": 1, "The economy is doing reasonably well. there is some weakness in retail and manufacturing, but that has a lot to do with long term secular (vs. cyclical shifts) in the economy. the improvement qtr. over qtr. is minor but things are basically moving along as they have been over the past few years.": 1, "The economy is doing slightly better in the most recent quarter than it was previously, but it's going to be difficult to reach Trump's goal of 3\\% growth. His economic program is moving slowly, and growth reports have been mixed with increases and decreases.": 1, "The economy is doing very well and the stock market is going through the roof.": 1, "The economy is doing well, and things in the first quarter are up, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Trump administration, despite him continually trying to take credit for it.": 1, "The economy is doing well.": 1, "The economy is eventually going to go straight to - - - - because Donald Trump who is a complete total buffoon is our president.": 1, "The economy is getting used to Littlefingers , it has not slowed as expected but  it is still a long way from the Cheeto's promise of 3\\%.": 1, "The economy is going to improve in a lot of way going forward. the first quarter of this year is just a starting point. if congress would get their act together and work with the president, the economy will get so much better in the future.": 1, "The economy is growing at a little over 1\\%. There is more consumer spending, but the goal of 3\\% growth rate seems entirely unlikely.": 1, "The economy is growing at a sluggish pace, it's nothing fantastic but at the same time it is growing. Considering the law decade, this might be the new normal, the years of 3% economic growth seem to be a thing of the past. Trump hasn't delivered a single one of his economic promises so far.": 1, "The economy is growing at a steady rate with a positive outlook into the future, but not without the usual bumps along the way as a country's GDP can fluctuate at random.": 1, "The economy is growing slightly but at a slower rate than predicated and about half the rate of 1990s growth.": 1, "The economy is growing slowly. Trump has not completed many of his tasks in the first 5 months.": 1, "The economy is growing, though at a slower rate since Q2 of 2016.

Its going to be an uphill climb to get the economy to grow by 3\\%.": 1, "The economy is not improving under Trump. He has put unqualified people at all positions of government. He is also the most unqualified and disgusting president we have ever had.

I'm sure he'll take the credit for exporting and job growth, but that's from the Obama Administration policies.

There has been little action in the Trump administration.": 1, "The economy is still not showing any signs of improvement under Trump. None of Trumps proposals for tax reform have gained any sort of traction. Trump wants to get the economy to numbers not seen since the 1990s and many economists say there is little to no chance of that happening and the numbers back it up. So far, the economy has continued a slight downward slope.": 1, "The economy is still stagnate despite efforts to jump start it. Typically, politicians claim that deregulation and tax-cuts will create jobs but the numbers don't lie.": 1, "The economy is very stagnant. There are things that are going on with growth that have been similar to years past. The GDP is moving like a turtle. If Trump is to do what he said he would, he needs to get his programs running so that we can see the 3 percent growth in GDP he promised.": 1, "The economy isn't doing as well as it use to and growth has slowed down significantly. This may be due to trump but things will probably get better in the future.": 1, "The economy isn't really growing, as expected.

We need a boast in spending and consumer confidence.": 1, "The economy seems good statistically but I'm a little concerned about geo-politics getting in the way. We both agree that so called president Trump is a hot head and I think we'll likely see some of military action either in the middle east or east Asia as a distraction from his Russian collusion investigation. This will bring the markets down and productivity will be stifled so the current data is very fragile.": 1, "The economy seems to be on the upswing according to a Reuters article I read. It has nothing to do with Trump's efforts as his policies have yet to be implemented.": 1, "The economy slowed a bit in the first quarter but there were still signs that the economy is growing.

Things are not going down and it seems things might be starting to go well.": 1, "The economy slowed less than economists expected it would, with a 1.2\\% growth, which isn't great, but not as bad as expected. It was caused by consumer spending and an increase in exports.": 1, "The economy under the new Republican presidency is slowing crumbling.

I fear what will happen if rates continue to fall and growth continues to slow down.": 1, "The economy, as measured by the GDP is still more or less not really growing. It is not far off from the same middle of 1-2 percent of 2016. Trump is looking for 3 percent like the 1990s. Other business metrics are mixed and negative.": 1, "The economy, while stable, has slowed down more than expected. Given the political climate, this is a surprise as promises were made. However, five months isn't really enough to see the result of any effective change. The numbers from the first quarter are admittedly lackluster, but I think the economy for the fiscal year should be evaluated as a whole. I'm for a wait-and-see approach, which I think the article was advocating without saying as much.

Experts are unsure if it will increase in the future.": 1, "The GDP is up a little but not what they were expecting considering all of the promises made.": 1, "The GDP isn't as terrible as predicted, though it's still not good.

The revenue and the inventory are improving too.": 1, "The GDP rose more than expected at 1.4 percent this past quarter compared to 1.2 percent the quarter before.

It showed modest growth, with mostly minor revisions from the previously released report for that period.": 1, "The Growth is a bit slower than what we had imagined, but still better than most recently. Businesses have started to pick up their inventory, and that is a great sign of things to come.

Spending and growth have both shown an increase, but are still far from the averages shown during the last couple years. ": 1, "The Trump Administration, and fellow Republicans have failed to improve the economy, so to speak. He expects to strengthen the economy by 3%, but has failed to reach that.  According to the Article, GDP growth has only reached a staggering 1.4%. The regulations rollbacks, tax cuts for corporations, and so forth have not worked, since the five months he has been office. Trickle down economics apparently is not working. ": 1, "The Trump agenda should lead to decreased regulations and business tax cuts, which Republicans believe will propel the economy to new highs.  The stock market has spiked to new highs while investors await word that infrastructure spending and tax cuts have been moved through the congress and are waiting for the President's signature. Hopefully, healthcare will get through under reconciliation and allow for the agenda to move forward.  Investors remain hopeful despite the stalls coming from inside the Belt Way.": 1, "The U.S. economy has slowed but not as sharply due to a jump in exports. It's a slow growth but at least it wasn't as bad as was originally thought.": 1, "The U.S. economy is growth because of consumer spending. Therefore, policies that encourage business development, reduce taxes, reduce regulations, and reduce dependence on foreign imports will stimulate the overall economy. Although generally the economy is improving, it will be difficult to meet the goals for GDP growth that the president is aiming to achieve. Nonetheless, the economy is increasing and therefore the current economic outlook is stable and improving compared less than a decade ago during the 2008 mortgage and stock market crisis.": 1, "The U.S. economy rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017. All of President Trump's initiatives have not started yet to boost the economy.": 1, "The U.S. economy slowed less in the first quarter due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Consumer spending rose although it was still the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013.": 1, "The U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.

Trump's plan to increase the economy to 3\\% is a tough hurdle.": 1, "The US economy grew at a revised rate of 1/4\\% in the first quarter of the year, well below the Trump administration's projections for the time period. The administration's projections of 3\\% growth seem foolhardy and doomed to fail. That rate of economic growth hasn't been seen since the 1990s. Other economic indicators were mixed.": 1, "The US economy has done quite successfully in the first quarter of this year. It slightly surpassed the projected growth.": 1, "The US economy has not slowed down as much as expected in the first quarter of this year. Although growth in many areas is less than expected, overall this is a positive sign. President Trump has not really achieved his promised 3\\% growth yet, but this type of growth hasn't been seen since the 1990s. We usually expect about 2\\% growth.": 1, "The US economy has started to grow at a faster rate than the previous years and even previous quarter. The recent presidency appears to have had an impact in the uptick and the economic market has not slowed but expanded and is expanding.": 1, "The US economy is shifting in an interesting direction. It slowed less sharply than predicted due to more consumer spending and greater US exports.": 1, "The US economy is slowing because of the man you voted for, Donald Trump.": 1, "The US economy picked up a little in the first quarter, raising 1.4\\% instead of 1.2\\%. President Trump has called for the US to grow at 3\\%, a feat that has not happened since the 1990's. Most economist think the US will grow around 1.5\\% for a while.": 1, "The US economy slowed less in the first quarter than estimates predicted because of unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Our gross domestic product increased at 1.4 percent instead of 1.2 percent. But this is just momentum from the previous administration. Trump has had no impact on any of it.": 1, "The US economy was better in the first quarter than expected due to higher consumer spending and in increase in exports. Good but still the slowest quarter in a year. We have a long way to go to meet Trumps expectations of 3\\% growth which hasn't been seen since the 1990's.

The government did not have the growth they were hoping for.": 1, "The US's GDP still looks OK this year.": 1, "The were so high spots in the final report from the Commerce Department, but not the three percent growth for which President Trump had hoped. There have been fits and starts in exports and economic growth and other area which are promised, but still not enough to meet the promised level.

Spending and savings are on a rollercoaster with unprecedented highs and lows. There appears to be some concern that the economy is having a hard time bouncing back. Thoughts?": 1, "There article threw a lot of values at me but didn't tell me what they meant to it is perfect for republicans who just make up their own - - - - anyway.  Apparently allot is higher then projected but it isn't good because profits are not but I don't know why as the article didn't tell me anything about what anything meant.": 1, "There has been some very marginal improvement but not compared to previous years.": 1, "There have been decreases in fiscal years and that there are methods that are in play to figure out how to increase funds.": 1, "There is a chance that the economy is boosted.

Trump hasn't even got down to the things he really wants to do and by the time he gets to it people will have more faith in what he can do and what he means what he say's he just doesn't talk the talk he is willing to walk the walk. It's going to take time to clear up the mess we have been in for 8 years it doesn't happen over night. It took 8 years to get here.": 1, "Things seemed to be looking up with the stock market. There has been in increase and that's usually a good thing. ": 1, "This article puts a lie to the Trump administration's claim that the nation's GDP would grow to 3\\%. It is simply not going to happen. As the article points out, GDP has not been that high since the 1990's. Republicans and their presidents have mismanaged the economy so badly, that Democratic presidents like Barack Obama have had to come in and clean up their mess.": 1, "This article says that the economy was growing twice as well as had been thought. Instead of about half a percentage point it was over a percentage point. Still far short of what Trump promised of three percent.": 1, "This government has not done anything it had promised. The economy is slowing down and even after tax cuts the spending has not gone up. Last year was much better. The growth rate has decreased.": 1, "This president is not performing as promised.": 1, "This shows that Trumpism is bad for the economy even if there have been some localized upward trends here and there.  Things are not quite as bad as economists have predicted but they are still bad compared to where they have been in quite some time.": 1, "Though growth has happened since Trump became president, it's not sustainable. He can't do the impossible, and I don't think he would be able to do it.": 1, "To be fully honest I probably wouldn't even mention this article while discussing politics/current events. The connection between federal government and national economics is not so strong as to be a clear political link, especially with a new president (five months in office is not long enough for any of his policies to have taken such an effect they'd move businesses on a massive scale). If I did discuss it, it'd be to eyeroll over the administration's semi-regular attempts to point to any economic boost as \\see! we're good for the economy!!!\\ even when referencing events which were put in motion years ago and have - - - - -all to do with government policies.": 1, "Trump expecting growth of 3% has happened since the 1990's, and he hasn't done anything yet to help that.": 1, "Trump has failed to kickstart the economy with his ideas and policies.  After five months the outlook is bleak despite marginal gains over expectations.": 1, "Trump has his work cut out for him, but it looks like we're heading in the right direction. The GDP grew more than expected, which indicates that the economy is on an upward trend. If Trump can implement those corporate tax cuts he was talking about, I think we can turn this economy around completely.": 1, "Trump has made some difference. He has moved slower than he wanted due to the Democrats not supporting him. The growth has been slow but it is still there. It will grow more in time. If the Democrats would support him more I see big, good changes for this country.": 1, "Trump has promised an economic increase of 3\\% but has yet to deliver on that.": 1, "Trump is doing as well at stimulating the economy as he said he would. Trump aimed for 3\\% gdp growth, which hasn't happened since the 90's, but we're still sitting at 1.4\\%. So, what a surprise, he's mostly just full of hot air.": 1, "Trump is good for the economy, things are on the up.": 1, "Trump is making progress on improving the economy. Getting the economy he wants will take awhile, but he is doing the right thing. I believe Trump will be great for America's economy. ": 1, "Trump is not doing what he said that the would do. You say that we needed someone that is not a politician but a business man, and he is still underperforming. We need change not stories and lies, or threatening tweets.": 1, "Trump is really far off the mark of 3% GDP growth he promised. GDP growth has dropped since he became President.": 1, "Trump is the worst isn't he?  Overestimating our economy will do nothing but hurt us.": 1, "Trump is trying to improve our economy.": 1, "Trump promised a 3\\% growth rate which has not been since the 90's. While there has been some growth this last quarter, it's not what it needs to be to hit Trump's goal.": 1, "Trump seems adamant that the market will grow, even though the downturn has been sharp. I just don't think he likes to face reality.": 1, "trump sucks and the economy is growing too quickly.": 1, "Trump thinks he can single handedly bring the economy back and even when it doesn't happen he still says it's so. I can't trust someone that egotistical and deluded to do anything for me, the country or the economy. Plus, I have always thought statistics were basically skewed to say whatever the person or entity wanted them to say. We are in deep trouble. It started years and a couple of administrations ago and is continuing on, no matter what the statistics or Trump say.": 1, "Trump's goal of a 3 percent GDP gain annually is unrealistic and hasn't been seen in nearly 20 years. The backbone of the economy is consumer consumption and Trump should focus on ensuring that wages rise so that can continue.  It is too early to see any effects from a Trump presidency.": 1, "Trump's plan to boost the economy with a 3\\% growth in GDP was unsuccessful. However, the economy was growing at a faster rate than expected.": 1, "Trump's promise to raise GDP to 3\\% has failed at less than half that.": 1, "US economy is doing slightly better, then expected , in the first quarter of 2017. GDP was growing 1.4\\% , while 1.2 \\% was expected. The goal ,President Trump stated before (3\\%) remains a challenge.": 1, "US first quarter growth is slow. President Trump's policies have yet to take affect on the macro economy. ": 1, "We are getting off to a slow start economically it seems. I remember Trump said he would have better than this. I am not discouraged yet though. I figure it will take time and it seems like we do have a president that has a Senate working against him anyway.": 1, "We need to boost GDP and a way to do that is cut taxes, or risk a recession.": 1, "We need to increase corporate profit.": 1, "We've had our first opportunity to see how the economy has performed under the Trump Administration.  I think that it's really too soon to tell how much of this report is due to Trump's performance/influence on the market, and how much might be a hold-over from 2016.  I will be much more interested in seeing his 2nd quarter numbers, and then, down the road, any year-over-year numbers that emerge, as a way of really assessing what Trump's impact on the economy really is.": 1, "Well the economy isn't doing all that well. Rather than the big increases Trump promised growth is still pretty slow.": 1, "Well, I have very little idea what I just read. It seems that the GDP grew at a slightly faster rate than expected but other economic signs are down. Growth is nowhere near what it was in the 1990s, and Trumps plan to raise (something) to 3 percent has not panned out.": 1, "Well, the numbers seem to show that Trump's economic programs are having little if any impact on the actual economy. Growth is at a slower rate than it has been since 2013. The promised infrastructure spending looks like it is not happening, and I doubt it will unless they raise taxes. Reading this report on the actual statistics does not show much progress towards his promised economic growth. Not surprising considering his actions I would say.": 1, "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy. Instead he has been embroiled in controversy after controversy, and his inability to control himself for one thing is very unnerving.  He has no previous experience in government and it shows. He is worthless in my opinion.": 1, "While Donald Trump is saying he is the most successful president since Abraham Lincoln in truth his economic plan hasn't even really began nevertheless have any ability to have any outcome yet. There is no health plan. Nothing has occurred. ": 1, "While I ******* hate Donald Trump it seems that he is actually doing some good. He is still a moron but he appears to be getting numbers up so that's": 1, "While I'm willing to give Trump a chance, I would be monitoring the economy's progress carefully, especially since it seems to affect most, if not all of us, in some way, shape or form.": 1, "While raising the profits from businesses is a goal with the Trump administration, it has proven to be challenging.": 1, "While that sounds positive, I don't know if its something Trump can take credit for. It is probably left over of the Obama administration. And Trump's goal of 3\\% is unrealistic considering he doesn't even have a tax proposal yet.": 1, "While the  estimate was revised upward, it seems that it is still a ways away from the 3% target of the administration, and is below the historical average.  With his agenda seemingly stalled, how do you think the President is going to get the nations economy humming again?": 1, "While the economy has improved somewhat, it is miniscule and not near Trump's targets.": 1, "While the economy still isn't back up to par, it seems to be moving a slightly better rate that was originally forecasted for this quarter. However, the government still has a long way to go to reach their preset goals.": 1, "Within the first quarter the economic growth exceeded expectations. We still have not hit President Trump's target of a 3\\% growth, however, a 1.6\\% increase is making progress.": 1, "You can't always expect a consistent growth rate all of the time. There are going to be slow times so don't be so worried when the economy slows down. The government should try to stay out of influencing the economy so that it might improve.": 1, "You have to look at the growth in a few positive ways. If corporations are doing better than they will hire more employees. They will also give better salaries to the employees that they already have. People are able to take care of themselves and their families. This is positive growth and in the few months that Trump has been in office he has done more than the previous President did.": 1, "You have to look at the positive growth. You want more citizens to have good paying jobs and this is the fast way to do it. When companies do well they hire. Simply. This gives money to those employed.": 1, "You know, the most recent reporting on the U.S. economy showed a bit of an improvement owing to some unexpectedly moderate rise in consumer spending \\& a bigger jump in exports. This also included a nice showing on Gross domestic product according to the Commerce Department final assessment on prior first quarter estimates, as Thursday's reporting says. A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate. The Trump administration's stated that it is still expecting a target of swiftly boosting U.S. growth to 3 percent. We shall see how things develop going foreword, given President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending.": 1, "You need to get your act together and support President Trump. Trump is trying to have our taxes, regulations, and infrastructure spending cut. President Trump is trying to get our country in a better place than what Obama left us in.": 1, "You need to start leaning to one side of the spectrum, at least on very specific issues. This article I read clearly indicates that the US economy is showing a nearly standstill growth. This is largely due to the do-nothing Republicans in the house \\& senate.

A lot of the programs he proposed to get there have yet to become a reality. Also exports and businesses did pretty well last quarter. Consumer is up a little bit as well. ": 1, "Apparently gdp went up more than expected in the first quarter, mainly due to increases in consumer spending. But we could have a discussion on whether consumer spending and gdp growth is really what we're looking for. I wonder about the environmental impacts of that. Other indicators were a little more or less than expected.": 1, "Apparently the national growth average is pretty low this year so far-not even as high as it was during the 1990s. I'm kind of not surprised to hear this based on how other things have been the last few years.": 1, "Apparently, the GDP rose a little bit more than was originally forecast. Consumer spending was a big driver, and it was higher than expected. Growth remains lower than we've seen in the 1990s and 2000s, however.": 1, "Basically Trump is growing America with the economy and jobs which trickle into many other thing like safety and security.": 1, "Basically, economic growth isn't happening as quickly as Trump expected. His plan for 3\\% is a bit of a lofty goal, as the current rate is about 1.2\\%, the lowest in recent memory. That said, it's not impossible, as the US had reached 3\\% back in the 90's, and even the Atlanta Federal Reserve is predicting an almost 3\\% increase in the second quarter of the year.": 1, "Business growth has not been as projected the past few month. Though the United States economic growth rate has stopped reaching the peak which it achieved in the 1990s. Most key indicator including housing, manufacturing, export..shows there is a slow but steady increase, but not at the level that has been as propserous as the past.": 1, "By going through the info, the economy is at a challenge right now. How would you think that could get fixed?": 1, "Consumer spending went up and gdp is going well.": 1, "Data is only half the story.  It's easy to cook the numbers without taking into account the sociological factors.  From  a citizens standpoint growth does not feel like it is real.  I question the methodology and the accuracy of economic grown claims.": 1, "Democrats would think that Trump is just lying to himself and everyone about the economic growth, and that we will see even more decrease soon.": 1, "Despite being a horrible human being, the country has prospered somewhat since Trump's getting into office.  Most likely just because of conservatives trying harder because they are motivated, not necessarily because of anything he has done.": 1, "Despite everything that's happening, the economy is doing well and will continue to do so. ": 1, "Despite many criticisms the economy si growing at a faster pace than expected.": 1, "Despite the earlier forecast Americas GDP has grown at 1.4 \\% rather than the 1.2 \\% that had been estimated.This despite the failure of President Trump's tax incentive, infrastructure spending etc that have yet to take off five months into his presidency.There have been marginal spending with businesses buying more machines, consumers spending more , auguring well for the GDP.": 1, "Despite the fact that the President's plan to speed up economic growth has not been quite as fast as had been predicted, it does seem that consumer psending is rising a little and I think that is because of consumer optimism that the plan is working. Even though slower than expected. There also seems to be some disappointing news in regard to manufacturing production but these things take time and I believe will occur in the long run.": 1, "Despite Trump's promise on behalf of Republicans that he is go to make America great again, he hasn't done much to help our economy.": 1, "Donald Trump doesn't care at all about the middle or working class. He is out to make the rich even richer and poor poorer.": 1, "Donald Trump is inaccurate in his GDP claims. There has been a small amount of GDP growth.": 1, "Donald Trump is very ambitious about the US growth but he sure has some challenges. It' sbeen five months and not much to show for.": 1, "Due to consumer spending, the US Economy had a boost in the first quarter. It was 1.4 instead of 1.2. Trump's economic program is not to thank because it hasn't gone into effect yet. Exports raised to 7.0.": 1, "Economic activity in the first quarter, annualized, was 1.2\\%, which was higher than expected due to an increase in consumer spending and exports. Donald Trump is aiming for 3\\% annualized economic growth, which hasn't been seen since the 1990s. It will be very hard to achieve 3\\% annualized economic growth.": 1, "Economic growth has been below normal. The economic changes promised by the Trump administration have yet to put forward in any meaningful way.": 1, "Economic growth in the first quarter was slightly higher than previously reported, but it's still slower than it has been in the past several years.

There is too much money being gained by big business.": 1, "Economic growth is steady in the US.": 1, "Economic growth is still slower than it used to be, but still seems to be trending upwards. It seems like consumers are spending more than anticipated, and this is helping eocnomic growth. However, even despite this growth, the eocnomy has not bounce dback as much as President Trump wanted it to when he took the presidency. Retail ales are also a bit disappointing this quarter.

The Trump presidency isn't showing a significant growth rate in the economy yet but it looks to be pretty promising.": 1, "Even though the economy is slowing given time it will pick back up. Just give some time for Trump's initiatives to take affect. The article states a lot of slowing down but it does state that those initiatives have not begun as yet.": 1, "Even though Trump and his administration along with the Republican majority congress don't know their left hand from their right hand, business seems to be on the upswing. For some reason the economy likes Republicans. Probably because they give enormous tax breaks to the rich to make them richer while taking away from every one else to pay for it.": 1, "Even though we are making a progress, the rate of economic growth is just took slow.  We need to do something to jump start the economy. The slow growth of 1.6\\% is not acceptable. Democrat should outline their economic agenda that would help the country.  A lot of people are beginning to worry about the economy.  Democrat should let people know what they are going to do to make sure that we have substantial growth in out economy.": 1, "Every tiem there is a new president the economy takes a hit. It takes time for change to happen. No matter how fast a candidate says it will happen it never does. Just because people dont like trump doesn't mean he wont deliver on his promises.": 1, "Experts are saying the first quarter of this year actually did better than they forecasted. However, Trump has yet to get started on some of the things that could majorly affect our economy, so we have to see how that goes.": 1, "First quarter GDP growth was revised from 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent. It was a relatively slow growth period. From various indicators like consumer spending, the economy grew, but fairly slowly.": 1, "Focus on actions and make laws that would actually benefit both the businesses and consumers. The consumer holds the key to economic growth, and suppressing them will inflect upon the economic growth of the country. Stop buying into Trump's antics about how the economy is growing and foster real change in the economy.": 1, "For someone with a financial background, who enjoys reading the business section of the newspaper, I would recommend to an Independent not to read this article. The article presents figure after figure after figure. It makes your head spin. Estimates are purely that estimtes. Reported growth of the GNP or any other financial data can be too easily manipulated to report what one wants to prove. I would tell an Independent to look beyond this article and study the stock market, especially teh S\\&P 500.

Go figure!": 1, "For the most part, it would seem that our economy is doing well, and growing!": 1, "GDP came in at 1.4\\% which was slower than expected growth rate. The president's administration is promising 3\\% GDP which their economic policies. The Jan thru March data is irrelevant due to calculation error by the government.": 1, "GDP doesn't really mean anything.": 1, "GDP for the first quarter was revised upwards, coming in better than previously reported. That was due to greater consumer spending and exports than previously believed. However, growth is still relatively low and the economic moves Trump intended to make in regulations, taxes, and elsewehre, haven't happened yet, and aren't yet being reflected in teh economy, even in anticipation. So we'll see whether the U.S. economy can ever get back to growth higher than 2\\%.": 1, "GDP growth has been much less than expcted, and even further less than that promised by President Trumps proposed policy changes.": 1, "GDP growth has been the slowest since the second quarter of last year. Economic growth is also at the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013. The new presidency is bad for the economy so far.": 1, "GDP growth has increased slightly to 1.4 % in the first quarter of 2017. This very modest increase is thought to be due to higher consumer spending and an increase in exports. It is still a far cry from the fast 3% growth promised by Trump. A sustained  GDP growth of 3 % has not been seen since the 1990s. Average GDP growth is around 2% over the last several years.": 1, "GDP growth is at 1.4 percent.": 1, "GDP growth is up, consumer spending is up.": 1, "GDP Growth slowed down in the last quarter.": 1, "GDP growth was revised to be a little better than initially thought for the first quarter. The economy still has a way to go to reach a GDP growth of 3\\%. Trumps pro business ideas have yet to take effect. ": 1, "GDP growth was slightly higher than expected last quarter. Consumer confidence is up. This is continuing the same trend at the tail end of the Obama administration.

The current administration wants to see it grow at 3\\%. The USA hasn't seen that kind of growth since teh 1990's and the Internet bubble.

Trump is struggling to lift the economy as fast as he would have liked. ": 1, "GDP went up higher than expected the first quarter but it's never very high in that quarter.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently forecasts annualized GDP growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. Exports in the first quarter were revised to show a gain of 7.0 percent from the previously reported 5.8 percent. Business spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a 7.8 percent rate in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated.": 1, "Growth in the first quarter of the year was slow, though not as slow as previously expected.  It is a challenge for the administration to do what it promised and get economic growth to 3  percent.": 1, "Growth in the united states is slowing down.": 1, "Growth is happening but at a very slow pace and that is unlikely that the Trump administration's promise of 3\\% growth will actually be able to occur.": 1, "Growth is slow, but there's growth. I don't really care about the economy, at least, not in statistics and numbers.": 1, "Growth of the economy has indeed slowed, but not by as much as had first been predicted. Despite that, though, growth rate in general is slower than the previous year and expected growth is unchanged. Also, the President's goal of 3\\% growth still seems unreachable.": 1, "Hey, I didn't realize the Republican party was doing so well this term!": 1, "Honestly, it was not easy to read the article I just read. At first, I thought the article was saying that there was an increase in the economy due to consumer purchasing and exports, but further down the article, it started to state that other consumer spending was at a low and corporate profits had dropped. So, I guess the economy is growing in some areas and suffering in others.": 1, "I acknowledge the relative strength of the economy so far during the Trump administration.": 1, "I believe the eocnomy will turn around greatly. I believe our goal of 3.0 percent is viable. It may take a little time, but with this administration I believe our economy will grow rapidly. ": 1, "I bring up the point in the article where it states, that President Donald Trump's plans to help the economy has yet to provide any substantial help since he has taken office. I would also mention that the US economy has not slowed as much as predicted because of higher consumer spending.": 1, "I can't believe trump is trying to hold on to unbelievable and unsubstantiated claims on the economy.  The data shows how it is responding to Obama's policies coupled with his election.  All his bluster and hot air cannot change the data.": 1, "I don't think there is much to say. Trump has not yet achieved his goals and it is probably too early to determine how Trump's policies will affect the economy. There isn't really much this article has to do with Trump in the first place, besides mentioning that his policies are not yet implemented.": 1, "I feel like the economy is on an uptick. Although President Trump has not been able to meet his agenda as he wanted, the economy is doing better. ": 1, "I feel that reducing costs can be a good thing. I feel this is leading down the right path.": 1, "I feel the presidents agenda is not being implemented. Nothing he promised is happening because all there is is constant controversy.": 1, "I find it troubling that we live in these time's. I think some thing should change immediately.

Our economy needs a boost, but I don't see a plan that will raise it by 3\\%.": 1, "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1, "I just read an article abotu the current economy. The economy isn't great yet but is better than expected. It certainly will be nice when it gets back to where it was in the nineties.": 1, "I just read an article in which Trump administration revise their report to make it look like our economy is doing great. Trump policy hasn't even get off the ground and they're reporting that our economy is gaining this much.": 1, "I just read an article on the revised numbers of GDP for the last quarter. All Icould get out of it was that it wasn;t as bad as they initially thoought. Beyond that, I could notget anything out the articale. It felt like I was reading mumbo jumbo. ": 1, "I just read an article saying that economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter of the year. However, it is still on the low side compared to recent years, and far short of the BS projection of the current regime in Washington. I guess it's going to take a little while for 45's administration to blunder into financial disaster for the country, but I have every confidence that they will do so, alas.": 1, "I just read an article that I barely understand. It said something about the US economy has slowed a lot. It also said that the Trump administration's plan of boosting the US economy to 3 percent was something that would be tough to do and that it has not been 3 percent since the 90s. Most of it was technical mumbo-jumbo but it said the US economy was bad.": 1, "I just read an article that seemed to indicate the economy is doing a little better than expected and it's giving me a little hope about the future.": 1, "I just read an economic article which states that the GDP growth in the first quarter was actually higher than initial estimates projected.  Consumer spending was higher than predicted and this could be a result of the president's policies although they are still getting off the ground.  It's not as good as it was in the 90's but still I think the economy is heading in the right direction.": 1, "I just read an interesting news article about the economy. It seems that they've been seeing some expansion in most sectors, albeit by just a little. I wonder if this means that corporations simply have more faith in Trump as president?": 1, "I read an article that basically said the eocnomy is still growing, albeit slower than before. The 3\\% increase the Trump administration has been aiming for hasn't been seen since the 90's, but it has still been steadily climbing since around the year 2000.": 1, "I read that in the macro sense, economic growth in the country overall is still relatively slow, but not as bad as was forecast. ": 1, "I read that the economy isn't growing as much as it did last year. The 1st quarter was one of the slowest in recent history.": 1, "I read that us gross domestic product had increased in the last few months. Eventhough there was initial increase in economy under Trumps administration now it has been suffering to keep up with the expected growth.": 1, "I read this article that was trying to portray President Trump in a poor light. It stated tha the has yet to get his financial plan off the ground 5 months into his presidency. It is so ridiculous how th emedi alike to spin everything instead of reporting unbiased facts. President Trump is much more financially responsible than the last several presidents.": 1, "I recently read that since the year 2000 our economy has grown at a 2 percent rate every year. Trump is hoping to raise that to 3 percent. The growth of our economy has slowed down. ": 1, "I saw that they revised first quarter GDP growth up a couple of ticks.": 1, "I see that we are not meeting the rates that were expected and we are being hit with losses and I don't know what to expect in this world. I don't understand everything, but I saw lose and no expectations met. I do not understand government and what is happening or why this is happening.": 1, "I think both parties need to work together to fix the economy. The stats in the article indicate that growth is slow or next to none, and that there needs to be change.": 1, "I think if you want spending to increase, there would have to be more help for the middle class. We can't spend more if we're barely scraping by to pay our bills. ": 1, "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy o rnot. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1, "I think the economy and the state of the union is kind of up in the air. People are trying to get a handle on where we are heading. I do feel positive about the direction we're going and if we continue on this path it will be positive for all of us.": 1, "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1, "I'd say Trump is being effective with his plan but it needs more time to fully work out the way he intends it to work.": 1, "I'm not sure about the article. It seemed to emphasize negative aspects of an uptick in growth. I get that the growth numbers seem beind the goal of 3\\%. It takes time to change, but wonder if 3\\% might be too ambitious. still it's growing and I don't understand the \\down\\ emphasis of the article.": 1, "I've heard that Donald Trump has actually had an increase in GDP growth. It looks like businesses are on the right track in gaining profits. What are your thoughts on that?": 1, "I've read a really interesting article the other day. Did you know that gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 annual rate instead of 1.2 last month? It is still the slowest growth rate but during January - march it tends to under perform. Also, president donald trump's economic program of tax cuts still hasn't been done, despite him being in office for five months. What's the problem?": 1, "Im surprised about how tremendously well the economy is starting to improve in the U.S. Even if it is getting better slowly is still a positive aspect. Hopefully it will continue and open up more opportunities and resources required for people to live more successful lives. ": 1, "In general the first quarter of this year was a disappointment not meeting target levels set by President Trump.": 1, "In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and exports performed much better than expected. The country is on the right track under Trump and this can be seen in the optimism shown by both consumers and businesses. People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possibel for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1, "Instead of the 1.2 percent increase that usually occurs, there was a 1.4 increase this past month.": 1, "It appears like the economy did better than expected. However it was not by much. Still in teh category of the slowest growth in quite some time.": 1, "It appears the Trump administration is having a hard time implementing all the policies and things he said he would. It must be very disappointing to you as Republican especially since it is Republican controlled congress as well! Republicans have the presidency and control both houses of congress and they still can't even come up with something to repeal and replace Obama Care Affordable Care Act let alone fix the economy! Must be very discouraging indeed.": 1, "It appears, based on the article, that our country's economic growth has somewhat improved rather than the forecasts have predicted would occur.": 1, "It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the Trump administration economic policies 5 months into his administration. There are a great deal of numbers that give conflicting accounts of the current economy but the bottom line is the economy is growing, exports are increasing, inventories are down and the unemployment rate is staying consistent. IT will be interesting if \\America First\\ works when looked at over a reasonable amount of time.": 1, "It looks as though the economy is doing fairly well. Consumer spending is up and this is driving the upswing in other things. Jobs are on the rise by a small rise. Businesses are seeing tax relief which allows them to hire.": 1, "It looks like our current president has been doing good things for the economy lately.": 1, "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing a little better than expected, but less well than hoped. I guess maybe it'll continue to go up?": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing better than previously thought. As a nation we are reporting better than we are. I would recommend evaluating what is causing the increase to the GDP and see if we can boost these items further.": 1, "It seems as though the economy is not recovering at a very quick rate. The 1990s saw the best growth years. Predictions about growth have been wrong also, we are behind what the predictions have said would happen.": 1, "It seems fairly obvious that for all of Trumps promises, the economy is continuing to stagnate, and there is very little growth happening.": 1, "It seems like the economy is doing alright, it is not growing as quick as it had, but at least it is headed in the right direction.": 1, "It seems like the economy is no longer stable. One minute the economy is doing great but then data reflects that is TRULY not!  I wish Obama was back in office. At least we saw great improvements with the economy since his early presidency. By the way this article stated the economy has been bad since 2000 I beg to differ!!": 1, "It seems like the economy is slowly gaining ground, but it will be interesting to see how the new policies that President Trump is trying to enact will affect the economy.": 1, "It seems like the eocnomic numbers are verymixed. But, I still don't think Trump can take any credit for the positive things that came out of it as his policies have not really been implemented.": 1, "It seems that consumer confidence has been up since Trump won. And that's even with the Democrats trying to dampen economic growth by slowing Trump down in his tax plan. Imagine how it will be onece it is passed.": 1, "It seems that earnings in spending and similar transactions are better than slightly predicted and trump has nothing to do with it. However values are still some of the lowest we have seen in a while.": 1, "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as PResident Trump predicted, it is still going in a postive direction.": 1, "It seems that the economy is slowly knitting itself back together, no thanks to Trump and the GOP in congress.": 1, "It seems that the spending rate isn't falling as quickly as had been projected. Trumps plan to increase the economy at a 3\\% rate was ambitious to say the least and make note of the fact that his economic plans haven't gotten off the ground even five months into his presidency.": 1, "It takes time to see lasting effects of presidential changes to economic policy.": 1, "It will be interesting to see if the Trump administration can pull off 3\\% GDP growth since the economy has grown 2\\% a year roughly for the past decade.": 1, "It would appear that in the new President's first five months in office he has not been able to fulfill his promises to booth economic growth in the United States. He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1, "It would be nice if we could get tax reform done this year, it's nice to see somebody making some kind of effort to rollback the encroachment of the adnimistrative state and reign in excessive regulation by un-elected bureaucrats, and I'm hopeful the two major parties can find a way to work together on much-needed and over-delayed nationwide infrastructure investments.": 1, "It's shocking that the percentage is higher than expected, but it's still tough that overall it is a low number. The president is pushing his luck wanting 3 percent.": 1, "Its a ever changing thing when it comes to the stock market.": 1, "Its been 5 months since the new President's presidency and his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending has not made an impact.": 1, "Its surprising that growth has been such a challenge. And profits fell after tax in teh first quarter after rising the last 3 months.": 1, "Looking at this article it is proof that the economy is growing under the current Republican administration. It is growing a bit slower than expected, but that might look to change. It's still going to be difficult to reach a 3 percent yearly growth..": 1, "Looks like we should have voted with you, for Hillary Clinton.  Our man Trump is not living up to his promises.  He said 3 percent growth, but nope.": 1, "Love or hate Trump, you can't argue with the performance of the economy since he's taken over. The GDP doesn't lie and it's way up as is consumer spending. I don't like the guy, but Republican/conservative methods are proven.": 1, "Most economic aspects of the country are improving, at least slightly. The targeted growth rate of 3\\% yearly is challenging, but there's some growth.": 1, "Most of this is carryover from the Obama administration, we're still too early to tell what sort of impact Trump's economic policies will have.": 1, "National gross domestic product has grown by only 1.1-1.4 percent in the first quarter which is pretty low even though trump and his administration were hoping to get it to grow by 3\\% compared to last year.": 1, "Obama's economy continues to chug along but Trump's inaction is slowly causing damage.": 1, "Our country is in danger, nothing is being done.

The growth will help with jobs and the economy.": 1, "Our economy is getting weaker everyday. President Trump has offer false hope to everyone who voted for him. He has failed as a president. You can' tpromise to do something and not do it. It is his fault tha tour economy is dwindling.": 1, "Our economy isn't doing as well as we hoped it would under the new administration.": 1, "Our economy this quarter increased by 1.4 and it was predicted to be 1.2. It is still a slow growth compare last year but it still a good news.": 1, "Our main goal is to advance our country and communitites to have a better life for their amilies and not have to work like slaves. Under the current administration, our sales are dropping our cousin living is rising, we are feeling and many parts in the and ministration that we need to advance our country. Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us.

Our economy should be going up.": 1, "Overall, Trump's aim to increase the GDP growth to 3\\% is getting off to a very slow start.  He has not been able to implement any of his tax cuts that aim to help increase growth.  The GDP growth rate is now at 1.4\\% compared to 1.2\\% in previous months.  There appears to be more spending by businesses and consumers, but this is not getting us to the 3\\% GDP growth that Trump is aiming for.": 1, "President Trump had made plans of the cutting of spending in several different areas to increase GDP growth overall. The growth had been successful at 1.4\\% but is noted that it is one of the slowest growths to occur.": 1, "President Trump is already doing a good job helping the economy improve. While it still has a long way to go to get to a 3\\% growth, the economy actually did better in Q1 of 2017 than analysts first determined.": 1, "Promises made by the president during his campaign have not come through at all. Not one bit of legislation has gone through the Republican legislature. Obviously republicans are great and complaining and broken promises but are a do nothing party when in power.": 1, "Recent GDP growth has exceeded projections but still remains very low at an annual rate of 1.4\\%. This is still pretty far off of the target of 3\\% that the current administration is targeting.": 1, "Republicans cannot not even be successful with their new president with getting a clear budget cut done.": 1, "Seems like the economy is slowly starting to come back, despite all the bull- - - - politics.": 1, "Seems like your boy Trump isn't living up to all of his promises, huh?  We're not at that 3% he promised and it's not looking likely that we will be.": 1, "Since the year started, our nation has earned 1.4\\% than our total worth so far. That is called GDP. We are making good pace and making lots of money.": 1, "So far there have not been very much change in a good way since Donald Trump became presidnet. Companies have spend more and the numbers from the article do not look good. ": 1, "So the US economy is not as bad off as first thought. It's close but grew at a slightly better rate then. It's under the presidential estimate however. Also hey did you know consumer spending is 2/3's of the economy?": 1, "Some reported data about the economy seems to indicate that things are improving. ": 1, "The article discussed the GDP. The economy slowed less sharply than estimated because of consumer spending. However it was still a slow growth rate.": 1, "The article I read stated that GDP was still fairly low for the first quarter of 2017, and has not gotten up to 3\\% as offered by the Trump administration. However forecasters estimate teh 2nd quarter GDP to be 2.9\\%. Retail sales figures slumped in teh first quarter of 2017 and there are cyclical factors in teh governments' analysis that causes the first quarter GDP to always be a little deflated compared to other quarters of the year. ": 1, "The article is stating that there is growth, but it is small and there is a decline in the slowing down of the GDP. Even though the President is having trouble getting some programs off the ground There has been some growth. There has been an increase in consumer spending and exporting of goods.": 1, "The article really goes to show how slowly our economy is growing annually. At a 1.4 percent, it is only sightly higher above the 1.2 normal growth usually experienced. This tells us that whatever we are doing right now does not work. Our economy needs to go back to the 90's era where the growth was at a 3 percent rate.": 1, "The article reveals that the standard economic statistics are doing slightly better than expcted, but that the economy, judged be these standards is still not back to where it was some years ago.

Personally I am not sure how much thesen umbers reflect underlying reality.": 1, "The article said our economic situation is good just not as good as we were promised.": 1, "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others.

The economy is growing. It is not at target set by the government. Policies are slowly taking in effect.": 1, "The article talkeda bout economic growth and since Trump took office things are not as rosy as predicted. The GDP increased a bit more than expected due to consumer spending. Trumps promises of cuts and economic promises have yet to get off the ground, clearly written by a liberal. Also business spending was up.": 1, "The data is conflicting because there are both tentatively positive results withs omewhat negative results, so it's a mixed bag. There are things the current administration have set as goals which not only are not realized but may in fact be unrealistic: the drive for 3\\% is ridiculous in the light that such a thing hasn't been seen since the 90's and even then it was lower. That was 30 years ago.": 1, "The decrease in the economy. The average of 3\\% growth hasn't been seen since the 1990's.

Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit. Blaming Trump for the current economy is very unfair since he's only been in office a very sthort time but Democrats will say anything to drag him down. Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1, "The economy has been doing so much better since the election of Trump because the stock market has faith in our President for the first time in 8 years. The main stream media does not report on the truth of the matter because they wish the public to not see how well President Trump is doing for our country. They prefer to lie and make people think Trump is failing. The economy,job market, has all improved and it is all because of Trump. If he had lost things would not have improved a bit.": 1, "The Economy has been on a slow climb. President Trump had planned to boost by 3\\% a year but is currently only around half of that right now.

It showed some growth at the beginning of the year but that would be due to actions taken during Obama's term.": 1, "The economy has not performed as expected. Trump's efforts have yet to show any results, and while in some case things are good, such as consumption, other areas fall short of expectations.": 1, "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in teh economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1, "The economy has remained roughly the same since the new administration has taken over.

It just goes right over my head.": 1, "The economy is currently at it's slowest for quite some time.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected per the GDP measure.

I think it's because the expectations of tax cuts that will drive spending.": 1, "The economy is doing better than those who think of these things, thought it would. I surprise, especially exports and such being up. Lots of trade with other countries, even during the current administration.": 1, "The economy is doing marginally better than initially thought. But we are still way to dependent on consuming.": 1, "The economy is doing resonably well. there is some weakness in retail and manufacturing, but that has a lot to do with long term secular (vs cyclical shifts) in the economy. the improvement qtr over qtr is minor but things are basically moving along as they have been over the past few years.": 1, "The economy is doing slightly better in the most recent quarter than it was previously, but it's going to be difficult to reach Trump's goal of 3\\% growth.

None of Trumps proposals for tax reform have gained any sort of traction.

Instead of about half a percentage point it was over a percentage point. Still far short of what Trump promised of three percent.": 1, "This government has not done anything it had promised. The economy is slowing down and even after tax cuts the spending has not gone up. Last year was much better. The growth rate has decreased.": 1, "This president is not performing as promised.": 1, "This shows that Trumpism is bad for the economy even if there have been some localized upward trends here and there.  Things are not quite as bad as economists have predicted but they are still bad compared to where they have been in quite some time.": 1, "Though growth has happened since Trump became president, it's not sustainable. He can't do the impossible, and I don't think he would be able to do it.": 1, "To be fully honest I probably wouldn't even mention this article while discussing politics/current events. The connection between federal government and national economics is not so strong as to be a clear political link, especially with a new president (five months in office is not long enough for any of his policies to have taken such an effect they'd move businesses on a massive scale). If I did discuss it, it'd be to eyeroll over the administration's semi-regular attempts to point to any economic boost as \\see! we're good for the economy!!!\\ even when referencing events which were put in motion years ago and have - - - - -all to do with government policies.": 1, "Trump expecting growth of 3% has happened since the 1990's, and he hasn't done anything yet to help that.": 1, "Trump has failed to kickstart the economy with his ideas and policies.  After five months the outlook is bleak despite marginal gains over expectations.": 1, "Trump has his work cut out for him, but it looks like we're heading in the right direction.

If Trump can implement those corporate tax cuts he was talking about, I think we can turn this economy around completely.": 1, "Trump has made some difference. He has moved slower than he wanted due to the Democrats not supporting him. The growth has been slow but it is still there. It will grow more in time.

I just don't think he likes to face reality.": 1, "trump sucks and the economy is growing too quickly.": 1, "Trump thinks he can single handedly bring the economy back and even when it doesn't happen he still says it's so. I can't trust someone that egotistical and deluded to do anything for me, the country or the economy.

It started years and a couple of administrations ago adn is continuing on, no matter what the statistics or Trump say.": 1, "Trump's goal of a 3 percent GDP gain annually is unrealistic and hasn't been seen in nearly 20 years.

I think that it's really too soon to tell how much of this report is due to Trump's performance/influence on the market, and how much might be a hold-over from 2016.  I will be much more interested in seeing his 2nd quarter numbers, and then, down the road, any year-over-year numbers that emerge, as a way of really assessing what Trump's impact on the economy really is.": 1, "Well the economy isn't doing all that well. Rather than the big increases Trump promised growth is still pretty slow.": 1, "Well, I have very little idea what I just read. It seems that the GDP grew at a slightly faster rate than expected but other economic signs are down. Growth is nowhere near what it was in the 1990s, and Trumps plan to raise (something) to 3 percent has not panned out.": 1, "Well, the numbers seem to show that Trump's economic programs are having little if any impact on the actual economy. Growth is at a slower rate than it has been since 2013. The promised infrastructure spending looks like it is not happening, and I doubt it will unless they raise taxes. Reading this report on the actual statistics does not show much progress towards his promised economic growth. Not surprising considering his actions I would say.": 1, "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy. Instead he has been embroiled in controversy after controversy, and his inabilty to control himself for one thing is very unnerving.  He has no previous experience in government and it shows. He is worthless in my opinion.": 1, "While Donald Trump is saying he is the most successful president since Abraham Lincoln in truth his economic plan hasn't even really began nevertheless have any ability to have any outcome yet.

However, the government still has a long way to go to reach their preset goals.": 1, "While the the estimate was revised upward, it seems that it is still a ways away from the 3% target of the administration, and is below the historical average.  With his agenda seemingly stalled, how do you think the President is going to get the nations economy humming again?": 1, "Within the first quarter the economic growth exceeded expectations. We still have not hit President Trump's target of a 3\\% growth, however, a 1.6\\% increase is making progress.": 1, "You can't always expect a consistent growth rate all of the time. There are going ot be slow times so don't be so worried when teh economy slows down. The government should try to stay out of influencing the economy so that it might improve.": 1, "You have to look at the growth in a few positive ways. If corporations are doing better than they will hire more employees. They will also give better salaries to the employees that they already have. People are able to take care of themselves and their families. This is positive growth and in the few months that Trump has been in office he has done more than the previous President did.": 1, "You have to look at the positive growth.

This gives money to those employed.": 1, "You know, the most recent reporting on the U.S. economy showed a bit of an improvement owing to some unexpectedly moderate rise in consumer psending \\& a bigger jump in exports. This also included a nice showing on Gross domestic product according to the Commerce Department final assessment on prior first quarter estimates, as Thursday's reporting says. A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate.

President Trump is trying to get our country in a better place than what Obama left us in.": 1, "You need to start leaning to one side of the spectrum, at least on very specific issues. This article I read clearly indicates that the US economy is showing a nearly standstill growth. This is largely due to the do-nothign Republicans in the house \\& senate.

There isn't really much this article has to do with Trump in the first place, besides mentioning that his policies are not yet implemented.": 1, "I feel like the economy is on an uptick. Although President Trump has not been able to meet his agenda as he wanted, the economy is doing better. ": 1, "I feel that reducing costs can be a good thing. I feel this is leading down the right path.": 1, "I feel the presidents agenda is not being implemented. Nothing he promised is happening because all there is is constant controversy.": 1, "I find it troubling that we live in these time's. I think some thing should change immediately. ": 1, "I have doubts that Trump's economic forecast will come to pass. Our economy needs a boost, but I don't see a plan that will raise it by 3\\%.": 1, "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1, "I just read an article abotu the current economy. The economy isn't great yet but is better than expected. It certainly will be nice when it gets back to where it was in the nineties.": 1, "I just read an article in which Trump administration revise their report to make it look like our economy is doing great. Trump policy hasn't even get off the ground and they're reporting that our economy is gaining this much.": 1, "I just read an article on the revised numbers of GDP for the last quarter. All Icould get out of it was that it wasn;t as bad as they initially thoought. Beyond that, I could notget anything out the articale. It felt like I was reading mumbo jumbo. ": 1, "I just read an article saying that economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter of the year. However, it is still on the low side compared to recent years, and far short of the BS projection of the current regime in Washington. I guess it's going to take a little while for 45's administration to blunder into financial disaster for the country, but I have every confidence that they will do so, alas.": 1, "I just read an article that I barely understand. It said something about the US economy has slowed a lot. It also said that the Trump administration's plan of boosting the US economy to 3 percent was something that would be tough to do and that it has not been 3 percent since the 90s. Most of it was technical mumbo-jumbo but it said the US economy was bad.": 1, "I just read an article that seemed to indicate the economy is doing a little better than expected and it's giving me a little hope about the future.": 1, "I just read an economic article which states that the GDP growth in the first quarter was actually higher than initial estimates projected.  Consumer spending was higher than predicted and this could be a result of the president's policies although they are still getting off the ground.  It's not as good as it was in the 90's but still I think the economy is heading in the right direction.": 1, "I just read an interesting news article about the economy. It seems that they've been seeing some expansion in most sectors, albeit by just a little. I wonder if this means that corporations simply have more faith in Trump as president?": 1, "I read an article that basically said the eocnomy is still growing, albeit slower than before. The 3\\% increase the Trump administration has been aiming for hasn't been seen since the 90's, but it has still been steadily climbing since around the year 2000.": 1, "I read that in the macro sense, economic growth in the country overall is still relatively slow, but not as bad as was forecast. ": 1, "I read that the economy isn't growing as much as it did last year. The 1st quarter was one of the slowest in recent history.": 1, "I read that us gross domestic product had increased in the last few months. Eventhough there was initial increase in economy under Trumps administration now it has been suffering to keep up with the expected growth.": 1, "I read this article that was trying to portray President Trump in a poor light. It stated tha the has yet to get his financial plan off the ground 5 months into his presidency. It is so ridiculous how th emedi alike to spin everything instead of reporting unbiased facts. President Trump is much more financially responsible than the last several presidents.": 1, "I recently read that since the year 2000 our economy has grown at a 2 percent rate every year. Trump is hoping to raise that to 3 percent. The growth of our economy has slowed down. ": 1, "I saw that they revised first quarter GDP growth up a couple of ticks.": 1, "I see that we are not meeting the rates that were expected and we are being hit with losses and I don't know what to expect in this world. I don't understand everything, but I saw lose and no expectations met. I do not understand government and what is happening or why this is happening.": 1, "I think both parties need to work together to fix the economy. The stats in the article indicate that growth is slow or next to none, and that there needs to be change.": 1, "I think if you want spending to increase, there would have to be more help for the middle class. We can't spend more if we're barely scraping by to pay our bills. ": 1, "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy o rnot. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1, "I think the economy and the state of the union is kind of up in the air. People are trying to get a handle on where we are heading. I do feel positive about the direction we're going and if we continue on this path it will be positive for all of us.": 1, "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1, "I'd say Trump is being effective with his plan but it needs more time to fully work out the way he intends it to work.": 1, "I'm not sure about the article. It seemed to emphasize negative aspects of an uptick in growth. I get that the growth numbers seem beind the goal of 3\\%. It takes time to change, but wonder if 3\\% might be too ambitious. still it's growing and I don't understand the \\down\\ emphasis of the article.": 1, "I've heard that Donald Trump has actually had an increase in GDP growth. It looks like businesses are on the right track in gaining profits. What are your thoughts on that?": 1, "I've read a really interesting article the other day. Did you know that gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 annual rate instead of 1.2 last month? It is still the slowest growth rate but during January - march it tends to under perform. Also, president donald trump's economic program of tax cuts still hasn't been done, despite him being in office for five months. What's the problem?": 1, "Im surprised about how tremendously well the economy is starting to improve in the U.S. Even if it is getting better slowly is still a positive aspect. Hopefully it will continue and open up more opportunities and resources required for people to live more successful lives. ": 1, "In general the first quarter of this year was a disappointment not meeting target levels set by President Trump.": 1, "In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and exports performed much better than expected. The country is on the right track under Trump and this can be seen in the optimism shown by both consumers and businesses. People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possibel for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1, "Instead of the 1.2 percent increase that usually occurs, there was a 1.4 increase this past month.": 1, "It appears like the economy did better than expected. However it was not by much. Still in teh category of the slowest growth in quite some time.": 1, "It appears the Trump administration is having a hard time implementing all the policies and things he said he would. It must be very disappointing to you as Republican especially since it is Republican controlled congress as well! Republicans have the presidency and control both houses of congress and they still can't even come up with something to repeal and replace Obama Care Affordable Care Act let alone fix the economy! Must be very discouraging indeed.": 1, "It appears, based on the article, that our country's economic growth has somewhat improved rather than the forecasts have predicted would occur.": 1, "It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the Trump administration economic policies 5 months into his administration. There are a great deal of numbers that give conflicting accounts of the current economy but the bottom line is the economy is growing, exports are increasing, inventories are down and the unemployment rate is staying consistent. IT will be interesting if \\America First\\ works when looked at over a reasonable amount of time.": 1, "It looks as though the economy is doing fairly well. Consumer spending is up and this is driving the upswing in other things. Jobs are on the rise by a small rise. Businesses are seeing tax relief which allows them to hire.": 1, "It looks like our current president has been doing good things for the economy lately.": 1, "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing a little better than expected, but less well than hoped. I guess maybe it'll continue to go up?": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing better than previously thought. As a nation we are reporting better than we are. I would recommend evaluating what is causing the increase to the GDP and see if we can boost these items further.": 1, "It seems as though the economy is not recovering at a very quick rate. The 1990s saw the best growth years. Predictions about growth have been wrong also, we are behind what the predictions have said would happen.": 1, "It seems fairly obvious that for all of Trumps promises, the economy is continuing to stagnate, and there is very little growth happening.": 1, "It seems like the economy is doing alright, it is not growing as quick as it had, but at least it is headed in the right direction.": 1, "It seems like the economy is no longer stable. One minute the economy is doing great but then data reflects that is TRULY not!  I wish Obama was back in office. At least we saw great improvements with the economy since his early presidency. By the way this article stated the economy has been bad since 2000 I beg to differ!!": 1, "It seems like the economy is slowly gaining ground, but it will be interesting to see how the new policies that President Trump is trying to enact will affect the economy.": 1, "It seems like the eocnomic numbers are verymixed. But, I still don't think Trump can take any credit for the positive things that came out of it as his policies have not really been implemented.": 1, "It seems that consumer confidence has been up since Trump won. And that's even with the Democrats trying to dampen economic growth by slowing Trump down in his tax plan. Imagine how it will be onece it is passed.": 1, "It seems that earnings in spending and similar transactions are better than slightly predicted and trump has nothing to do with it. However values are still some of the lowest we have seen in a while.": 1, "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as PResident Trump predicted, it is still going in a postive direction.": 1, "It seems that the economy is slowly knitting itself back together, no thanks to Trump and the GOP in congress.": 1, "It seems that the spending rate isn't falling as quickly as had been projected. Trumps plan to increase the economy at a 3\\% rate was ambitious to say the least and make note of the fact that his economic plans haven't gotten off the ground even five months into his presidency.": 1, "It takes time to see lasting effects of presidential changes to economic policy.": 1, "It will be interesting to see if the Trump administration can pull off 3\\% GDP growth since the economy has grown 2\\% a year roughly for the past decade.": 1, "It would appear that in the new President's first five months in office he has not been able to fulfill his promises to booth economic growth in the United States. He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1, "It would be nice if we could get tax reform done this year, it's nice to see somebody making some kind of effort to rollback the encroachment of the adnimistrative state and reign in excessive regulation by un-elected bureaucrats, and I'm hopeful the two major parties can find a way to work together on much-needed and over-delayed nationwide infrastructure investments.": 1, "It's shocking that the percentage is higher than expected, but it's still tough that overall it is a low number. The president is pushing his luck wanting 3 percent.": 1, "Its a ever changing thing when it comes to the stock market.": 1, "Its been 5 months since the new President's presidency and his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending has not made an impact.": 1, "Its surprising that growth has been such a challenge. And profits fell after tax in teh first quarter after rising the last 3 months.": 1, "Looking at this article it is proof that the economy is growing under the current Republican administration. It is growing a bit slower than expected, but that might look to change. It's still going to be difficult to reach a 3 percent yearly growth..": 1, "Looks like we should have voted with you, for Hillary Clinton.  Our man Trump is not living up to his promises.  He said 3 percent growth, but nope.": 1, "Love or hate Trump, you can't argue with the performance of the economy since he's taken over. The GDP doesn't lie and it's way up as is consumer spending. I don't like the guy, but Republican/conservative methods are proven.": 1, "Most economic aspects of the country are improving, at least slightly. The targeted growth rate of 3\\% yearly is challenging, but there's some growth.": 1, "Most of this is carryover from the Obama administration, we're still too early to tell what sort of impact Trump's economic policies will have.": 1, "National gross domestic product has grown by only 1.1-1.4 percent in the first quarter which is pretty low even though trump and his administration were hoping to get it to grow by 3\\% compared to last year.": 1, "Obama's economy continues to chug along but Trump's inaction is slowly causing damage.": 1, "Our country is in danger, nothing is being done. The numbers aren't even accurate!": 1, "Our current president has not made any issues or passed any bills so far and the GDP is lower than expected, although it was higher from Jan. to march, but then dropped off.": 1, "Our economy has been slowly grinding higher even though the policies that Trump plans to bring into action have not materialized yet.": 1, "Our economy has come to a crawl, but it is growing. Trump is still trying to get his tax cuts and the like off the ground.": 1, "Our economy is doing fairly well. We are growing as a country and we are selling more products. The growth will help with jobs and the economy.": 1, "Our economy is getting weaker everyday. President Trump has offer false hope to everyone who voted for him. He has failed as a president. You can' tpromise to do something and not do it. It is his fault tha tour economy is dwindling.": 1, "Our economy isn't doing as well as we hoped it would under the new administration.": 1, "Our economy this quarter increased by 1.4 and it was predicted to be 1.2. It is still a slow growth compare last year but it still a good news.": 1, "Our main goal is to advance our country and communitites to have a better life for their amilies and not have to work like slaves. Under the current administration, our sales are dropping our cousin living is rising, we are feeling and many parts in the and ministration that we need to advance our country. Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us. I don't care who you are, for the love of God there needs to be an impeachment.": 1, "Our president needs to do a way better job. Stuff needs to get done. Our economy should be going up.": 1, "Overall, Trump's aim to increase the GDP growth to 3\\% is getting off to a very slow start.  He has not been able to implement any of his tax cuts that aim to help increase growth.  The GDP growth rate is now at 1.4\\% compared to 1.2\\% in previous months.  There appears to be more spending by businesses and consumers, but this is not getting us to the 3\\% GDP growth that Trump is aiming for.": 1, "President Trump had made plans of the cutting of spending in several different areas to increase GDP growth overall. The growth had been successful at 1.4\\% but is noted that it is one of the slowest growths to occur.": 1, "President Trump is already doing a good job helping the economy improve. While it still has a long way to go to get to a 3\\% growth, the economy actually did better in Q1 of 2017 than analysts first determined.": 1, "Promises made by the president during his campaign have not come through at all. Not one bit of legislation has gone through the Republican legislature. Obviously republicans are great and complaining and broken promises but are a do nothing party when in power.": 1, "Recent GDP growth has exceeded projections but still remains very low at an annual rate of 1.4\\%. This is still pretty far off of the target of 3\\% that the current administration is targeting.": 1, "Republicans cannot not even be successful with their new president with getting a clear budget cut done.": 1, "Seems like the economy is slowly starting to come back, despite all the bull- - - - politics.": 1, "Seems like your boy Trump isn't living up to all of his promises, huh?  We're not at that 3% he promised and it's not looking likely that we will be.": 1, "Since the year started, our nation has earned 1.4\\% than our total worth so far. That is called GDP. We are making good pace and making lots of money.": 1, "So far there have not been very much change in a good way since Donald Trump became presidnet. Companies have spend more and the numbers from the article do not look good. ": 1, "So the US economy is not as bad off as first thought. It's close but grew at a slightly better rate then. It's under the presidential estimate however. Also hey did you know consumer spending is 2/3's of the economy?": 1, "Some reported data about the economy seems to indicate that things are improving. ": 1, "The article discussed the GDP. The economy slowed less sharply than estimated because of consumer spending. However it was still a slow growth rate.": 1, "The article I read stated that GDP was still fairly low for the first quarter of 2017, and has not gotten up to 3\\% as offered by the Trump administration. However forecasters estimate teh 2nd quarter GDP to be 2.9\\%. Retail sales figures slumped in teh first quarter of 2017 and there are cyclical factors in teh governments' analysis that causes the first quarter GDP to always be a little deflated compared to other quarters of the year. ": 1, "The article is stating that there is growth, but it is small and there is a decline in the slowing down of the GDP. Even though the President is having trouble getting some programs off the ground There has been some growth. There has been an increase in consumer spending and exporting of goods.": 1, "The article really goes to show how slowly our economy is growing annually. At a 1.4 percent, it is only sightly higher above the 1.2 normal growth usually experienced. This tells us that whatever we are doing right now does not work. Our economy needs to go back to the 90's era where the growth was at a 3 percent rate.": 1, "The article reveals that the standard economic statistics are doing slightly better than expcted, but that the economy, judged be these standards is still not back to where it was some years ago. It is not clear how well Turmp's program is doing with regards to the economy. Personally I am not sure how much thesen umbers reflect underlying reality.": 1, "The article said our economic situation is good just not as good as we were promised.": 1, "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others. Seriously, considering the turmoil the country has been in over the course of the past 5 months it's surprising the economy is doing as well as it is.": 1, "The article stated that we are doing better than what originally was predicted in terms of the national economy.": 1, "The article states that the economy is not improving and has been stagnant over a large number of years.": 1, "The article talked about the growth of the economy. The economy is growing. It is not at target set by the government. Policies are slowly taking in effect.": 1, "The article talkeda bout economic growth and since Trump took office things are not as rosy as predicted. The GDP increased a bit more than expected due to consumer spending. Trumps promises of cuts and economic promises have yet to get off the ground, clearly written by a liberal. Also business spending was up.": 1, "The data is conflicting because there are both tentatively positive results withs omewhat negative results, so it's a mixed bag. There are things the current administration have set as goals which not only are not realized but may in fact be unrealistic: the drive for 3\\% is ridiculous in the light that such a thing hasn't been seen since the 90's and even then it was lower. That was 30 years ago.": 1, "The decrease in the economy. The average of 3\\% growth hasn't been seen since the 1990's. I was upset to hear this and it needs to change and more opportunities need to become available for the American people and stop relying so much on outside sources.": 1, "The econ is getting better and rising slowly.": 1, "The economic growth has not risen as expected. Trumps plans have all not taken effect yet after 5 months into his presidency.": 1, "The economic growth in US in first quarte rof this year was higher then expected but still way lower than 3\\%. 3 \\% is what new President said will happen.

Consumer spending increase drove the higher than expected growth.  It continues to be unlikely that the annualized growth will be the 3\\% that Trump had promised.": 1, "The economy did better than was projected. We had a 1.4\\% increase when a 1.2\\% increase was expected. Trump wants a 3\\% increase which hasn't happened since 1990. With his tax cuts and infrastructure spending, he might get there.": 1, "The economy grew 1.6\\% last quarter.": 1, "The economy grew at a slightly faster rate than expected last quarter but it is still rather slow. It is going to be hard to get back to 3\\% growth.": 1, "The economy had only modest growth in this year's first quarter. President Trump has not put into effect most of the ideas he had to spur economic growth, such as infrastructure improvement, deregulation, etc.": 1, "The economy handed to Trump by Obama was in poor shape. Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit. Blaming Trump for the current economy is very unfair since he's only been in office a very sthort time but Democrats will say anything to drag him down. Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1, "The economy has been doing so much better since the election of Trump because the stock market has faith in our President for the first time in 8 years. The main stream media does not report on the truth of the matter because they wish the public to not see how well President Trump is doing for our country. They prefer to lie and make people think Trump is failing. The economy,job market, has all improved and it is all because of Trump. If he had lost things would not have improved a bit.": 1, "The Economy has been on a slow climb. President Trump had planned to boost by 3\\% a year but is currently only around half of that right now.

": 1, "The economy has gotten slightly better since Trump became president, but it hasn't improved as drastically as was predicted. ": 1, "The economy has not improved since Trump took office.  It showed some growth at the beginning of the year but that would be due to actions taken during Obama's term.": 1, "The economy has not performed as expected. Trump's efforts have yet to show any results, and while in some case things are good, such as consumption, other areas fall short of expectations.": 1, "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in teh economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1, "The economy has remained roughly the same since the new administration has taken over. While it has not slowed as much as predicted, it also has not gained as much as promised. There are a wide variety of factors that go into determining the overall growth such as exports, government spending, and sales to name a few.": 1, "The economy has slowed more than was expected in the past quarter.  The government's projections are probably off by about half.": 1, "The economy hasnt been specifically going through a downfall but it certainly has been slowed down im saying in a way of consumption and imports along with exports.": 1, "The economy is boosting in the first quarter under president Trump, but not as much as expected. The economy slowed more than expected due to higher consumer spending and more exports.": 1, "The economy is complex, it's not growing as much as we thought it would, but it is slowly improving. I don't know much about the economy, what I just read was mostly gibberish to me personally. It just goes right over my head.": 1, "The economy is currently at it's slowest for quite some time.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected per the GDP measure. Consumer spending and exports were higher than predicted. The economy's rate of expansion has been relatively low, so this may be a suggestion of that changing.": 1, "The economy is doing better than expected. I think it's because the expectations of tax cuts that will drive spending.": 1, "The economy is doing better than those who think of these things, thought it would. I surprise, especially exports and such being up. Lots of trade with other countries, even during the current administration.": 1, "The economy is doing marginally better than initially thought. But we are still way to dependent on consuming.": 1, "The economy is doing resonably well. there is some weakness in retail and manufacturing, but that has a lot to do with long term secular (vs cyclical shifts) in the economy. the improvement qtr over qtr is minor but things are basically moving along as they have been over the past few years.": 1, "The economy is doing slightly better in the most recent quarter than it was previously, but it's going to be difficult to reach Trump's goal of 3\\% growth.

Growth is at a slower rate than it has been since 2013. The promised infrastructure spending looks like it is not happening, and I doubt it will unless they raise taxes. Reading this report on the actual statistics does not show much progress towards his promised economic growth. Not surprising considering his actions I would say.": 1, "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy.

President Trump is giving tax cuts for major businesses, which have been exporting a lot more. Consumers have also affected the GDP by spending more than usual. Although their is some growth, it is much smaller than what the US has done in the best and these trade deals could prove to be valuable for the future of our economy.": 1, "All the things you feared would happen with trump are happening, and despite all the promises he made, he has not come through with any of them yet, and the outlook for keeping his promises looks NOT promising.": 1, "Although I don't agree with much of what trump says, he's not doing that bad of a job.": 1, "Although the current market is slowly rising, I'm not sure the market can sustain it. It's been below average, or where it should be since the late 90s. With that being said, can we really blame a president's actions. Sure, the policies accepted or veto have a direct correlation, however, it appears that the true power of the US economics lies with some other group/party.": 1, "Although the economy is not improving at the rate that it has in the recent past, this past quarter's performance was better than projected.": 1, "Although the GDP rose the article puts the information in a negative light. The entire article is written with a negative tone despite gains in many key areas.": 1, "An article I just read just stated that the US economy grew at the slowest rate since last year. It is growing slightly faster than originally estimated, at 1.4\\% in this 2nd quarter, but that is still pretty far from Trump's goal of 3\\%. A lot of the programs he proposed to get there have yet to become a reality. Also exports and businesses did pretty well last quarter. Consumer is up a little bit as well. ": 1, "Apparently gdp went up more than expected in the first quarter, mainly due to increases in consumer spending. But we could have a discussion on whether consumer spending and gdp growth is really what we're looking for. I wonder about the environmental impacts of that. Other indicators were a little more or less than expected.": 1, "Apparently the national growth average is pretty low this year so far-not even as high as it was during the 1990s. I'm kind of not surprised to hear this based on how other things have been the last few years.": 1, "Apparently, the GDP rose a little bit more than was originally forecast. Consumer spending was a big driver, and it was higher than expected. Growth remains lower than we've seen in the 1990s and 2000s, however.": 1, "Basically Trump is growing America with the economy and jobs which trickle into many other thing like safety and security.": 1, "Basically, economic growth isn't happening as quickly as Trump expected. His plan for 3\\% is a bit of a lofty goal, as the current rate is about 1.2\\%, the lowest in recent memory. That said, it's not impossible, as the US had reached 3\\% back in the 90's, and even the Atlanta Federal Reserve is predicting an almost 3\\% increase in the second quarter of the year.": 1, "Business growth has not been as projected the past few month. Though the United States economic growth rate has stopped reaching the peak which it achieved in the 1990s. Most key indicator including housing, manufacturing, export..shows there is a slow but steady increase, but not at the level that has been as propserous as the past.": 1, "By going through the info, the economy is at a challenge right now. How would you think that could get fixed?": 1, "Consumer spending went up and gdp is going well.": 1, "Data is only half the story.  It's easy to cook the numbers without taking into account the sociological factors.  From  a citizens standpoint growth does not feel like it is real.  I question the methodology and the accuracy of economic grown claims.": 1, "Democrats would think that Trump is just lying to himself and everyone about the economic growth, and that we will see even more decrease soon.": 1, "Despite being a horrible human being, the country has prospered somewhat since Trump's getting into office.  Most likely just because of conservatives trying harder because they are motivated, not necessarily because of anything he has done.": 1, "Despite everything that's happening, the economy is doing well and will continue to do so. ": 1, "Despite many criticisms the economy si growing at a faster pace than expected.": 1, "Despite the earlier forecast Americas GDP has grown at 1.4 \\% rather than the 1.2 \\% that had been estimated.This despite the failure of President Trump's tax incentive, infrastructure spending etc that have yet to take off five months into his presidency.There have been marginal spending with businesses buying more machines, consumers spending more , auguring well for the GDP.": 1, "Despite the fact that the President's plan to speed up economic growth has not been quite as fast as had been predicted, it does seem that consumer psending is rising a little and I think that is because of consumer optimism that the plan is working. Even though slower than expected. There also seems to be some disappointing news in regard to manufacturing production but these things take time and I believe will occur in the long run.": 1, "Despite Trump's promise on behalf of Republicans that he is go to make America great again, he hasn't done much to help our economy.": 1, "Donald Trump doesn't care at all about the middle or working class. He is out to make the rich even richer and poor poorer.": 1, "Donald Trump is inaccurate in his GDP claims. There has been a small amount of GDP growth.": 1, "Donald Trump is very ambitious about the US growth but he sure has some challenges. It' sbeen five months and not much to show for.": 1, "Due to consumer spending, the US Economy had a boost in the first quarter. It was 1.4 instead of 1.2. Trump's economic program is not to thank because it hasn't gone into effect yet. Exports raised to 7.0.": 1, "Economic activity in the first quarter, annualized, was 1.2\\%, which was higher than expected due to an increase in consumer spending and exports. Donald Trump is aiming for 3\\% annualized economic growth, which hasn't been seen since the 1990s. It will be very hard to achieve 3\\% annualized economic growth.": 1, "Economic growth has been below normal. The economic changes promised by the Trump administration have yet to put forward in any meaningful way.": 1, "Economic growth in the first quarter was slightly higher than previously reported, but it's still slower than it has been in the past several years.

There is too much money being gained by big business.": 1, "Economic growth is steady in the US.": 1, "Economic growth is still slower than it used to be, but still seems to be trending upwards. It seems like consumers are spending more than anticipated, and this is helping eocnomic growth. However, even despite this growth, the eocnomy has not bounce dback as much as President Trump wanted it to when he took the presidency. Retail ales are also a bit disappointing this quarter.

We're doing okay but it's nothing like the growth Trump promised.": 1, "Economic indicators are looking more positive since Trump was elected, despite the fact his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground.": 1, "Economic spending is on the rise, slowly, but still rising.": 1, "Economics is confusing and things aren't improving as well as they were said they were going to.": 1, "Even though economists predicted GDP to remain unchanged, it actually increased over the past few months. The Trump presidency isn't showing a significant growth rate in the economy yet but it looks to be pretty promising.": 1, "Even though the economy is slowing given time it will pick back up. Just give some time for Trump's initiatives to take affect. The article states a lot of slowing down but it does state that those initiatives have not begun as yet.": 1, "Even though Trump and his administration along with the Republican majority congress don't know their left hand from their right hand, business seems to be on the upswing. For some reason the economy likes Republicans. Probably because they give enormous tax breaks to the rich to make them richer while taking away from every one else to pay for it.": 1, "Even though we are making a progress, the rate of economic growth is just took slow.  We need to do something to jump start the economy. The slow growth of 1.6\\% is not acceptable. Democrat should outline their economic agenda that would help the country.  A lot of people are beginning to worry about the economy.  Democrat should let people know what they are going to do to make sure that we have substantial growth in out economy.": 1, "Every tiem there is a new president the economy takes a hit.

Just because people dont like trump doesn't mean he wont deliver on his promises.": 1, "Experts are saying the first quarter of this year actually did better than they forecasted. However, Trump has yet to get started on some of the things that could majorly affect our economy, so we have to see how that goes.": 1, "First quarter GDP growth was revised from 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent. It was a relatively slow growth period. From various indicators like consumer spending, the economy grew, but fairly slowly.": 1, "Focus on actions and make laws that would actually benefit both the businesses and consumers. The consumer holds the key to economic growth, and suppressing them will inflect upon the economic growth of the country. Stop buying into Trump's antics about how the economy is growing and foster real change in the economy.": 1, "For someone with a financial background, who enjoys reading the business section of the newspaper, I would recommend to an Independent not to read this article. The article presents figure after figure after figure. It makes your head spin. Estimates are purely that estimtes. Reported growth of the GNP or any other financial data can be too easily manipulated to report what one wants to prove. I would tell an Independent to look beyond this article and study the stock market, especially teh S\\&P 500.

Go figure!": 1, "For the most part, it would seem that our economy is doing well, and growing!": 1, "GDP came in at 1.4\\% which was slower than expected growth rate.

The Jan thru March data is irrelevant due to calculation error by the government.": 1, "GDP doesn't really mean anything.": 1, "GDP for the first quarter was revised upwards, coming in better than previously reported. That was due to greater consumer spending and exports than previously believed. However, growth is still relatively low and the economic moves Trump intended to make in regulations, taxes, and elsewehre, haven't happened yet, and aren't yet being reflected in teh economy, even in anticipation. So we'll see whether the U.S. economy can ever get back to growth higher than 2\\%.": 1, "GDP growth has been much less than expcted, and even further less than that promised by President Trumps proposed policy changes.": 1, "GDP growth has been the slowest since the second quarter of last year. Economic growth is also at the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013. The new presidency is bad for the economy so far.": 1, "GDP growth has increased slightly to 1.4 % in the first quarter of 2017. This very modest increase is thought to be due to higher consumer spending and an increase in exports. It is still a far cry from the fast 3% growth promised by Trump. A sustained  GDP growth of 3 % has not been seen since the 1990s. Average GDP growth is around 2% over the last several years.": 1, "GDP growth is at 1.4 percent.": 1, "GDP growth is up, consumer spending is up.": 1, "GDP Growth slowed down in the last quarter.": 1, "GDP growth was revised to be a little better than initially thought for the first quarter. The economy still has a way to go to reach a GDP growth of 3\\%. Trumps pro business ideas have yet to take effect. ": 1, "GDP growth was slightly higher than expected last quarter.

Trump is struggling to lift the economy as fast as he would have liked. ": 1, "GDP went up higher than expected the first quarter but it's never very high in that quarter.

I don't really care about the economy, at least, not in statistics and numbers.": 1, "Growth of the economy has indeed slowed, but not by as much as had first been predicted. Despite that, though, growth rate in general is slower than the previous year and expected growth is unchanged. Also, the President's goal of 3\\% growth still seems unreachable.": 1, "Hey, I didn't realize the Republican party was doing so well this term!": 1, "Honestly, it was not easy to read the article I just read. At first, I thought the article was saying that there was an increase in the economy due to consumer purchasing and exports, but further down the article, it started to state that other consumer spending was at a low and corporate profits had dropped. So, I guess the economy is growing in some areas and suffering in others.": 1, "I acknowledge the relative strength of the economy so far during the Trump administration.": 1, "I believe the eocnomy will turn around greatly. I believe our goal of 3.0 percent is viable. It may take a little time, but with this administration I believe our economy will grow rapidly. ": 1, "I bring up the point in the article where it states, that President Donald Trump's plans to help the economy has yet to provide any substantial help since he has taken office. I would also mention that the US economy has not slowed as much as predicted because of higher consumer spending.": 1, "I can't believe trump is trying to hold on to unbelievable and unsubstantiated claims on the economy.  The data shows how it is responding to Obama's policies coupled with his election.  All his bluster and hot air cannot change the data.": 1, "I don't think there is much to say. Trump has not yet achieved his goals and it is probably too early to determine how Trump's policies will affect the economy. There isn't really much this article has to do with Trump in the first place, besides mentioning that his policies are not yet implemented.": 1, "I feel like the economy is on an uptick. Although President Trump has not been able to meet his agenda as he wanted, the economy is doing better. ": 1, "I feel that reducing costs can be a good thing. I feel this is leading down the right path.": 1, "I feel the presidents agenda is not being implemented. Nothing he promised is happening because all there is is constant controversy.": 1, "I find it troubling that we live in these time's. I think some thing should change immediately. ": 1, "I have doubts that Trump's economic forecast will come to pass. Our economy needs a boost, but I don't see a plan that will raise it by 3\\%.": 1, "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1, "I just read an article abotu the current economy. The economy isn't great yet but is better than expected. It certainly will be nice when it gets back to where it was in the nineties.": 1, "I just read an article in which Trump administration revise their report to make it look like our economy is doing great. Trump policy hasn't even get off the ground and they're reporting that our economy is gaining this much.": 1, "I just read an article on the revised numbers of GDP for the last quarter. All Icould get out of it was that it wasn;t as bad as they initially thoought. Beyond that, I could notget anything out the articale. It felt like I was reading mumbo jumbo. ": 1, "I just read an article saying that economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter of the year. However, it is still on the low side compared to recent years, and far short of the BS projection of the current regime in Washington. I guess it's going to take a little while for 45's administration to blunder into financial disaster for the country, but I have every confidence that they will do so, alas.": 1, "I just read an article that I barely understand. It said something about the US economy has slowed a lot. It also said that the Trump administration's plan of boosting the US economy to 3 percent was something that would be tough to do and that it has not been 3 percent since the 90s. Most of it was technical mumbo-jumbo but it said the US economy was bad.": 1, "I just read an article that seemed to indicate the economy is doing a little better than expected and it's giving me a little hope about the future.": 1, "I just read an economic article which states that the GDP growth in the first quarter was actually higher than initial estimates projected.  Consumer spending was higher than predicted and this could be a result of the president's policies although they are still getting off the ground.  It's not as good as it was in the 90's but still I think the economy is heading in the right direction.": 1, "I just read an interesting news article about the economy. It seems that they've been seeing some expansion in most sectors, albeit by just a little. I wonder if this means that corporations simply have more faith in Trump as president?": 1, "I read an article that basically said the eocnomy is still growing, albeit slower than before. The 3\\% increase the Trump administration has been aiming for hasn't been seen since the 90's, but it has still been steadily climbing since around the year 2000.": 1, "I read that in the macro sense, economic growth in the country overall is still relatively slow, but not as bad as was forecast. ": 1, "I read that the economy isn't growing as much as it did last year. The 1st quarter was one of the slowest in recent history.": 1, "I read that us gross domestic product had increased in the last few months. Eventhough there was initial increase in economy under Trumps administration now it has been suffering to keep up with the expected growth.": 1, "I read this article that was trying to portray President Trump in a poor light. It stated tha the has yet to get his financial plan off the ground 5 months into his presidency. It is so ridiculous how th emedi alike to spin everything instead of reporting unbiased facts. President Trump is much more financially responsible than the last several presidents.": 1, "I recently read that since the year 2000 our economy has grown at a 2 percent rate every year. Trump is hoping to raise that to 3 percent. The growth of our economy has slowed down. ": 1, "I saw that they revised first quarter GDP growth up a couple of ticks.": 1, "I see that we are not meeting the rates that were expected and we are being hit with losses and I don't know what to expect in this world. I don't understand everything, but I saw lose and no expectations met. I do not understand government and what is happening or why this is happening.": 1, "I think both parties need to work together to fix the economy. The stats in the article indicate that growth is slow or next to none, and that there needs to be change.": 1, "I think if you want spending to increase, there would have to be more help for the middle class. We can't spend more if we're barely scraping by to pay our bills. ": 1, "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy o rnot. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1, "I think the economy and the state of the union is kind of up in the air. People are trying to get a handle on where we are heading. I do feel positive about the direction we're going and if we continue on this path it will be positive for all of us.": 1, "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1, "I'd say Trump is being effective with his plan but it needs more time to fully work out the way he intends it to work.": 1, "I'm not sure about the article. It seemed to emphasize negative aspects of an uptick in growth. I get that the growth numbers seem beind the goal of 3\\%. It takes time to change, but wonder if 3\\% might be too ambitious. still it's growing and I don't understand the \\down\\ emphasis of the article.": 1, "I've heard that Donald Trump has actually had an increase in GDP growth. It looks like businesses are on the right track in gaining profits. What are your thoughts on that?": 1, "I've read a really interesting article the other day. Did you know that gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 annual rate instead of 1.2 last month? It is still the slowest growth rate but during January - march it tends to under perform. Also, president donald trump's economic program of tax cuts still hasn't been done, despite him being in office for five months. What's the problem?": 1, "Im surprised about how tremendously well the economy is starting to improve in the U.S. Even if it is getting better slowly is still a positive aspect. Hopefully it will continue and open up more opportunities and resources required for people to live more successful lives. ": 1, "In general the first quarter of this year was a disappointment not meeting target levels set by President Trump.": 1, "In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and exports performed much better than expected. The country is on the right track under Trump and this can be seen in the optimism shown by both consumers and businesses. People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possibel for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1, "Instead of the 1.2 percent increase that usually occurs, there was a 1.4 increase this past month.": 1, "It appears like the economy did better than expected. However it was not by much. Still in teh category of the slowest growth in quite some time.": 1, "It appears the Trump administration is having a hard time implementing all the policies and things he said he would. It must be very disappointing to you as Republican especially since it is Republican controlled congress as well! Republicans have the presidency and control both houses of congress and they still can't even come up with something to repeal and replace Obama Care Affordable Care Act let alone fix the economy! Must be very discouraging indeed.": 1, "It appears, based on the article, that our country's economic growth has somewhat improved rather than the forecasts have predicted would occur.": 1, "It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the Trump administration economic policies 5 months into his administration. There are a great deal of numbers that give conflicting accounts of the current economy but the bottom line is the economy is growing, exports are increasing, inventories are down and the unemployment rate is staying consistent. IT will be interesting if \\America First\\ works when looked at over a reasonable amount of time.": 1, "It looks as though the economy is doing fairly well. Consumer spending is up and this is driving the upswing in other things. Jobs are on the rise by a small rise. Businesses are seeing tax relief which allows them to hire.": 1, "It looks like our current president has been doing good things for the economy lately.": 1, "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing a little better than expected, but less well than hoped. I guess maybe it'll continue to go up?": 1, "It looks like the economy is doing better than previously thought. As a nation we are reporting better than we are. I would recommend evaluating what is causing the increase to the GDP and see if we can boost these items further.": 1, "It seems as though the economy is not recovering at a very quick rate. The 1990s saw the best growth years. Predictions about growth have been wrong also, we are behind what the predictions have said would happen.": 1, "It seems fairly obvious that for all of Trumps promises, the economy is continuing to stagnate, and there is very little growth happening.": 1, "It seems like the economy is doing alright, it is not growing as quick as it had, but at least it is headed in the right direction.": 1, "It seems like the economy is no longer stable. One minute the economy is doing great but then data reflects that is TRULY not!  I wish Obama was back in office. At least we saw great improvements with the economy since his early presidency. By the way this article stated the economy has been bad since 2000 I beg to differ!!": 1, "It seems like the economy is slowly gaining ground, but it will be interesting to see how the new policies that President Trump is trying to enact will affect the economy.": 1, "It seems like the eocnomic numbers are verymixed. But, I still don't think Trump can take any credit for the positive things that came out of it as his policies have not really been implemented.": 1, "It seems that consumer confidence has been up since Trump won. And that's even with the Democrats trying to dampen economic growth by slowing Trump down in his tax plan. Imagine how it will be onece it is passed.": 1, "It seems that earnings in spending and similar transactions are better than slightly predicted and trump has nothing to do with it. However values are still some of the lowest we have seen in a while.": 1, "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as PResident Trump predicted, it is still going in a postive direction.": 1, "It seems that the economy is slowly knitting itself back together, no thanks to Trump and the GOP in congress.": 1, "It seems that the spending rate isn't falling as quickly as had been projected. Trumps plan to increase the economy at a 3\\% rate was ambitious to say the least and make note of the fact that his economic plans haven't gotten off the ground even five months into his presidency.": 1, "It takes time to see lasting effects of presidential changes to economic policy.": 1, "It will be interesting to see if the Trump administration can pull off 3\\% GDP growth since the economy has grown 2\\% a year roughly for the past decade.": 1, "It would appear that in the new President's first five months in office he has not been able to fulfill his promises to booth economic growth in the United States. He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1, "It would be nice if we could get tax reform done this year, it's nice to see somebody making some kind of effort to rollback the encroachment of the adnimistrative state and reign in excessive regulation by un-elected bureaucrats, and I'm hopeful the two major parties can find a way to work together on much-needed and over-delayed nationwide infrastructure investments.": 1, "It's shocking that the percentage is higher than expected, but it's still tough that overall it is a low number. The president is pushing his luck wanting 3 percent.": 1, "Its a ever changing thing when it comes to the stock market.": 1, "Its been 5 months since the new President's presidency and his economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending has not made an impact.": 1, "Its surprising that growth has been such a challenge. And profits fell after tax in teh first quarter after rising the last 3 months.": 1, "Looking at this article it is proof that the economy is growing under the current Republican administration. It is growing a bit slower than expected, but that might look to change. It's still going to be difficult to reach a 3 percent yearly growth..": 1, "Looks like we should have voted with you, for Hillary Clinton.  Our man Trump is not living up to his promises.  He said 3 percent growth, but nope.": 1, "Love or hate Trump, you can't argue with the performance of the economy since he's taken over. The GDP doesn't lie and it's way up as is consumer spending. I don't like the guy, but Republican/conservative methods are proven.": 1, "Most economic aspects of the country are improving, at least slightly. The targeted growth rate of 3\\% yearly is challenging, but there's some growth.": 1, "Most of this is carryover from the Obama administration, we're still too early to tell what sort of impact Trump's economic policies will have.": 1, "National gross domestic product has grown by only 1.1-1.4 percent in the first quarter which is pretty low even though trump and his administration were hoping to get it to grow by 3\\% compared to last year.": 1, "Obama's economy continues to chug along but Trump's inaction is slowly causing damage.": 1, "Our country is in danger, nothing is being done.

It is his fault tha tour economy is dwindling.": 1, "Our economy isn't doing as well as we hoped it would under the new administration.": 1, "Our economy this quarter increased by 1.4 and it was predicted to be 1.2.

Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us.

Our economy should be going up.": 1, "Overall, Trump's aim to increase the GDP growth to 3\\% is getting off to a very slow start.  He has not been able to implement any of his tax cuts that aim to help increase growth.  The GDP growth rate is now at 1.4\\% compared to 1.2\\% in previous months.  There appears to be more spending by businesses and consumers, but this is not getting us to the 3\\% GDP growth that Trump is aiming for.": 1, "President Trump had made plans of the cutting of spending in several different areas to increase GDP growth overall. The growth had been successful at 1.4\\% but is noted that it is one of the slowest growths to occur.": 1, "President Trump is already doing a good job helping the economy improve. While it still has a long way to go to get to a 3\\% growth, the economy actually did better in Q1 of 2017 than analysts first determined.": 1, "Promises made by the president during his campaign have not come through at all. Not one bit of legislation has gone through the Republican legislature. Obviously republicans are great and complaining and broken promises but are a do nothing party when in power.": 1, "Recent GDP growth has exceeded projections but still remains very low at an annual rate of 1.4\\%.

Companies have spend more and the numbers from the article do not look good. ": 1, "So the US economy is not as bad off as first thought. It's close but grew at a slightly better rate then.

However it was still a slow growth rate.": 1, "The article I read stated that GDP was still fairly low for the first quarter of 2017, and has not gotten up to 3\\% as offered by the Trump administration. However forecasters estimate teh 2nd quarter GDP to be 2.9\\%.

There has been an increase in consumer spending and exporting of goods.": 1, "The article really goes to show how slowly our economy is growing annually. At a 1.4 percent, it is only sightly higher above the 1.2 normal growth usually experienced. This tells us that whatever we are doing right now does not work.

The economy is growing. It is not at target set by the government. Policies are slowly taking in effect.": 1, "The article talkeda bout economic growth and since Trump took office things are not as rosy as predicted. The GDP increased a bit more than expected due to consumer spending. Trumps promises of cuts and economic promises have yet to get off the ground, clearly written by a liberal. Also business spending was up.": 1, "The data is conflicting because there are both tentatively positive results withs omewhat negative results, so it's a mixed bag. There are things the current administration have set as goals which not only are not realized but may in fact be unrealistic: the drive for 3\\% is ridiculous in the light that such a thing hasn't been seen since the 90's and even then it was lower. That was 30 years ago.": 1, "The decrease in the economy. The average of 3\\% growth hasn't been seen since the 1990's.

Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit.

Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1, "The economy has been doing so much better since the election of Trump because the stock market has faith in our President for the first time in 8 years. The main stream media does not report on the truth of the matter because they wish the public to not see how well President Trump is doing for our country.

Trump's efforts have yet to show any results, and while in some case things are good, such as consumption, other areas fall short of expectations.": 1, "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in teh economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1, "The economy has remained roughly the same since the new administration has taken over.

The government did not have the growth they were hoping for.": 1, "The US's GDP still looks OK this year.": 1, "The were so high spots in the final report from teh Commerce Department, but not the three percent growth for which President Trump had hoped. There have been fits and starts in exports and economic growth and other area which are promised, but still not enough to meet the promised level. ": 1, "There appears to be significant discrepancies with the data that is being reported vs. what is actually happening. Spending and savings are on a rollercoaster with unprecedented highs and lows. There appears to be some concern that the economy is having a hard time boncingback. Thoughts?": 1, "There article threw a lot of values at me but didn't tell me what they meant to it is perfect for republicans who just make up their own - - - - anyway.  Apparently allot is higher then projected but it isn't good because profits are not but I don't know why as the article didn't tell me anything about what anything meant.": 1, "There has been some very marginal improvement but not compared to previous years.": 1, "There have been decreases in fiscal years and that there are methods that are in play to figure out how to increase funds.": 1, "There is a chance that the economy is boosted. There are some things that point to it slightly increasing.": 1, "There was higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports during the first quarter in the U.S. It was up 1.4 percent.": 1, "Things are being rewritten to show increases.": 1, "Things are turning around they have some good signs that we are headed in the right direction. Trump hasn't even got down to the things he really wants to do and by the time he gets to it people will have more faith in what he can do and what he means what he say's he just doesn't talk the talk he is willing to walk the walk. It's going to take time to clear up the mess we have been in for 8 years it doesn't happen over night. It took 8 years to get here.": 1, "Things seemed to be looking up with the stock market. There has been in increase and thats usually a good thing. ": 1, "This article puts a lie to the Trump administration's claim that the nation's GDP would grow to 3\\%. It is simply not going to happen. As the article points out, GDP has not been that high since the 1990's. Republicans and their presidents have mismanaged the economy so badly, that Democratic presidents like Barack Obama have had to come in and clean up their mess.": 1, "This article says that the economy was growing twice as well as had been thought. Instead of about half a percentage point it was over a percentage point. Still far short of what Trump promised of three percent.": 1, "This government has not done anything it had promised. The economy is slowing down and even after tax cuts the spending has not gone up. Last year was much better. The growth rate has decreased.": 1, "This president is not performing as promised.": 1, "This shows that Trumpism is bad for the economy even if there have been some localized upward trends here and there.  Things are not quite as bad as economists have predicted but they are still bad compared to where they have been in quite some time.": 1, "Though growth has happened since Trump became president, it's not sustainable. He can't do the impossible, and I don't think he would be able to do it.": 1, "To be fully honest I probably wouldn't even mention this article while discussing politics/current events. The connection between federal government and national economics is not so strong as to be a clear political link, especially with a new president (five months in office is not long enough for any of his policies to have taken such an effect they'd move businesses on a massive scale). If I did discuss it, it'd be to eyeroll over the administration's semi-regular attempts to point to any economic boost as \\see! we're good for the economy!!!\\ even when referencing events which were put in motion years ago and have - - - - -all to do with government policies.": 1, "Trump expecting growth of 3% has happened since the 1990's, and he hasn't done anything yet to help that.": 1, "Trump has failed to kickstart the economy with his ideas and policies.  After five months the outlook is bleak despite marginal gains over expectations.": 1, "Trump has his work cut out for him, but it looks like we're heading in the right direction. The GDP grew more than expected, which indicates that the economy is on an upward trend. If Trump can implement those corporate tax cuts he was talking about, I think we can turn this economy around completely.": 1, "Trump has made some difference. He has moved slower than he wanted due to the Democrats not supporting him. The growth has been slow but it is still there. It will grow more in time. If the Democrats would suppor thim more I see big, good changes for this country.": 1, "Trump has promised an economic increase of 3\\% but has yet to deliver on that.": 1, "Trump is doing as well at stimulating the economy as he said he would. Trump aimed for 3\\% gdp growth, which hasn't happened since the 90's, but we're still sitting at 1.4\\%. So, what a surprise, he's mostly just full of hot air.": 1, "Trump is good for the economy, things are on the up.": 1, "Trump is making progress on improving the economy. Getting the economy he wants iwll take awhile, but he is doing the right thing. I believe Trump will be great for America's economy. ": 1, "Trump is not doing what he said that the would do. You say that we needed someone that is not a politician but a business man, and he is still underperforming. We need change not stories and lies, or threatening tweets.": 1, "Trump is really far off the mark of 3% GDP growth he promised. GDP growth has dropped since he became President.": 1, "Trump is the worst isn't he?  Overestimating our economy will do nothing but hurt us.": 1, "Trump is trying to improve our economy.": 1, "Trump promised a 3\\% growth rate which has not been since the 90's. While there has been some growth this last quarter, it's not what it needs to be to hit Trump's goal.": 1, "Trump seems adamant that the market will grow, even though the downturn has been sharp. I just don't think he likes to face reality.": 1, "trump sucks and the economy is growing too quickly.": 1, "Trump thinks he can single handedly bring the economy back and even when it doesn't happen he still says it's so. I can't trust someone that egotistical and deluded to do anything for me, the country or the economy. Plus,I have always thought statistics were basically skewed to say whatever the person or entity wanted them to say. We are in deep trouble. It started years and a couple of administrations ago adn is continuing on, no matter what the statistics or Trump say.": 1, "Trump's goal of a 3 percent GDP gain annually is unrealistic and hasn't been seen in nearly 20 years. The backbone of the economy is consumer consumption and Trump should focus on ensuring that wages rise so that can continue.  It is too early to see any effects from a Trump presidency.": 1, "Trump's plan to boost the economy with a 3\\% growth in GDP was unsuccessful. However, the economy was growing at a faster rate than expected.": 1, "Trump's promise to raise GDP to 3\\% has failed at less than half that.": 1, "U.S. first-quarter GDP growth revised up to 1.4 percent\\nBy Lindsay Dunsmuir | Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent rate instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent pace. The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the prior three months.": 1, "US economy is doing slightly better, then expexted , in teh first quarter of 2017. GPD was growing 1.4\\% , while 1.2 \\% was expected. The goal ,President Trump stated before (3\\%) remains a challenge.": 1, "US first quarter growth is slow. President Trump's policies have yet to take affect on the macro economy. ": 1, "We are getting off to a slow start evonomically it seems.i remember Trump said he would have better than this.i am not discouraged yet though.i figure it will take time and it seems like we do have a rpesident that has a Senate working against him anyway.": 1, "We need to boost GDP and a way to do that is cut taxes, or risk a recession.": 1, "We need to increase corporate profit.": 1, "We've had our first opportunity to see how the economy has performed under the Trump Administration.  I think that it's really too soon to tell how much of this report is due to Trump's performance/influence on the market, and how much might be a hold-over from 2016.  I will be much more interested in seeing his 2nd quarter numbers, and then, down the road, any year-over-year numbers that emerge, as a way of really assessing what Trump's impact on the economy really is.": 1, "Well the economy isn't doing all that well. Rather than the big increases Trump promised growth is still pretty slow.": 1, "Well, I have very little idea what I just read. It seems that the GDP grew at a slightly faster rate than expected but other economic signs are down. Growth is nowhere near what it was in the 1990s, and Trumps plan to raise (something) to 3 percent has not panned out.": 1, "Well, the numbers seem to show that Trump's economic programs are having little if any impact on the actual economy. Growth is at a slower rate than it has been since 2013. The promised infrastructure spending looks like it is not happening, and I doubt it will unless they raise taxes. Reading this report on the actual statistics does not show much progress towards his promised economic growth. Not surprising considering his actions I would say.": 1, "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy. Instead he has been embroiled in controversy after controversy, and his inabilty to control himself for one thing is very unnerving.  He has no previous experience in government and it shows. He is worthless in my opinion.": 1, "While Donald Trump is saying he is the most successful president since Abraham Lincoln in truth his economic plan hasn't even really began nevertheless have any ability to have any outcome yet. There is no healthplan. Nothing has occurred. ": 1, "While I ******* hate Donald Trump it seems that he is actually doing some good. He is still a moron but he appears to be getting numbers up so thats": 1, "While I'm willing to give Trump a chance, I would be monitoring the economy's progress carefully, especially since it seems to affect most, if not all of us, in some way, shape or form.": 1, "While raising the profits from businesses is a goal with the Trump administration, it has proven to be challenging.": 1, "While that sounds positive, I don't know if its something Trump can take credit for. It is probably left over of the Obama administration. And Trump's goal of 3\\% is unrealistic considering he doesn't even have a tax proposal yet.": 1, "While the economy has improved somewhat, it is miniscule and not near Trump's targets.": 1, "While the economy still isn't back up to par, it seems to be moving a slightly better rate that was originally forcasted for this quarter. However, the government still has a long way to go to reach their preset goals.": 1, "While the the estimate was revised upward, it seems that it is still a ways away from the 3% target of the administration, and is below the historical average.  With his agenda seemingly stalled, how do you think the President is going to get the nations economy humming again?": 1, "Within the first quarter the economic growth exceeded expectations. We still have not hit President Trump's target of a 3\\% growth, however, a 1.6\\% increase is making progress.": 1, "You can't always expect a consistent growth rate all of the time. There are going ot be slow times so don't be so worried when teh economy slows down. The government should try to stay out of influencing the economy so that it might improve.": 1, "You have to look at the growth in a few positive ways. If corporations are doing better than they will hire more employees. They will also give better salaries to the employees that they already have. People are able to take care of themselves and their families. This is positive growth and in the few months that Trump has been in office he has done more than the previous President did.": 1, "You have to look at the positive growth. You want more citizens to have good paying jobs and this is the fast way to do it. When companies do well they hire. Simply. This gives money to those employed.": 1, "You know, the most recent reporting on the U.S. economy showed a bit of an improvement owing to some unexpectedly moderate rise in consumer psending \\& a bigger jump in exports. This also included a nice showing on Gross domestic product according to the Commerce Department final assessment on prior first quarter estimates, as Thursday's reporting says. A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate. The Trump administration's stated that it is still expecting a target of swiftly boosting U.S. growth to 3 percent. We shall see how things develop going foreword, given President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and infrastructure spending.": 1, "You need to get your act together and support President Trump. Trump is trying to have our taxes, regulations, and infrastructure spending cut. President Trump is trying to get our country in a better place than what Obama left us in.": 1, "You need to start leaning to one side of the spectrum, at least on very specific issues. This article I read clearly indicates that the US economy is showing a nearly standstill growth. This is largely due to the do-nothign Republicans in the house \\& senate. The Democratic way is the only way to progress this country forward. The growth rate is the slowest it has been in 5 years. Seems like the Obama administration was doing something right, eh?": 1, "You should read the pros and cons. Make an informed decision using your interpretation of what you understand in the article. Everyone has different takes on the subject.": 1, "You were right. Trump made promises about being able to grow the economy at a tremendous rate.
