The new rules seek to ensure greater inclusion of common societal goals in the procurement process. These goals include, besides other issues, environmental protection. Awarding public contracts on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender is provided as part of Article 67 of Directive 2014/24/EU; and Article 82 of Directive 2014/25/EU. However, \\economically advantegous\\\" is henceforth defined as including environmental aspects. Furthermore, the EU developed non-mandatory GPP criteria that aim to facilitate the inclusion of green requirements in public tender documents. Therefore, deviations from lowest-price bid for environmental reasons have been possible since the initial Directives of 2004. The newer ones do not fundamentally change this right of deviation.
