There also be a discussion on current drought/flood situation (at least recent phenomena).": 1,

This problem has gotten worse as more and more carbon dioxide polution is released into the atmosphere. Pollution is also damaging the ozone which results in increased temperatures as the ozone absorbs some heat. ": 1,

There isn't any Global warming or cooling, as after a period of years the climate does get colder and warmer, before returning back to normal. So climate change isn't happening, nor is it something to worry about.": 1,
                "The polar ice caps are melting, the seasons are changing, becoming hotter along with the change in weather patterns.  These are all signs that global warming is happening.  Between the amount of pollution and the deforestation of the earth it is no wonder that global warming is happening.": 1,

The climate change is a liberal agenda scheme to force us to lower our emissions and spend more on solar panels.

Glaciers have been measured to be shrinking. Melting of major ice forms like Greenland and Antarctica can make a significant problem in reducing land and threaten animal species that depend on ice. The water from melting glaciers run off into the oceans, raising sea levels.": 1,

The would also point out that the pace of which the ice caps were melting has slowed down in recent years - which disputes global warming.  ": 1,

                "They will tell me because the scientists say so, education is a big deal coming from global warming and young kids understand what it is and what it is like. I do not believe it because I have some doubts, for example, this climate change people are talking about may be a normal cycle in earth.": 1,

                "There is not unanimous agreement among scientists that climate change is happening. Climate change is also called global warming, which does not adequately explain why vast areas of the planet are suffering from dangerous cold and wet weather - eg. flooding, hurricanes, etc.": 1,
                "There is way to know that climate change is happening, it may just be the natural order of the Earth's cycle. The Earth may go through periods of warmth and coolness, and this may be one of those cycles.": 1,
                "Technology has become more advanced and at the same time, has become way more accessible than ever before.  Whereas in the past, only people of extreme wealth could afford the luxury of a gasoline powered automobile, it seems as though people who can barely afford to feed themselves and their families have access to at LEAST one gas powered vehicle if not more today.  Partner that with the increase in life expectancy, which in turn increases the world's living population, and you have a recipe for a greater human effect on anything.": 1,

                "There is no evidence for cilmate change. Plenty of scientists think otherwise. Scientists don't know everything. The weather has always been changeable. The evidence that shows climate change is happening has been manipulated.": 1,

                "In the 1970's scientists thought the world was going to get really cold again. There is proof that that Antarctica ice caps are growing not shrinking. Scientists just want funding for their research.": 1,
                "I think they would tell me that they believe that climate change is happening because experts who have studied the situation believe that it is. Additionally, there are signs that can be seen that it is happening. There is also evidence, the conclusions made by scientists and the methodology they used to determine their findings might not always be understandable to the layman but they are generally public and available for anyone else to make an analysis or at least read and try to understand. Also, I think they would agree because it makes sense - you cannot endlessly alter a closed system and expect it to remain unchanged.": 1,
                "Climate change is caused by nature, There is not sufficient proof that it is caused by man. ould adopt a wait and see attitude. No rush for now.": 1,

In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence.  It was called \\\\\"Global Warming\\\"\\\" and now it is called \\\"\\\"Climate Change\\\"\\\" basicly because there has been no global warming since 1997.  In the 1970's they believed it was global \\\"\\\"cooling\\\"\\\".  Through the centuries we have had different climate changes and only when politicians became involved did it become something \\\"\\\"man made\\\"\\\".\"": 1,
                "Glaciers in the arctic circle are melting and that can only be because of global warming.  All these tornados, floods, heat waves etc are caused by human's changing the natural climate.  SUV's are bad, you are bad if you drive a big car, I'm awesome because I drive a prius....  Pollution is affecting the ozone and that causes global warming.     Oh, the record cold?  Well really we mean global climate change....": 1,

                "That it's all liberal lies and propaganda to push for more green things. That there is no proof humans are causing it and scientist it's say that it is because they are liberals with an agenda. It could be natural causes and global warming is just cyclical": 1,
                "Of course it is happening. 99% of all scientists agree that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, which will lead to catastrophic consequences in the coming decades. How can you be so selfish to not care about the future of mankind?": 1,
                "They would say that the temperature measurements from the past were not very accurate to judge that the temperature is rising now.  They would also argue that it is just media hype and politics making up global warming.": 1,
                "There is much evidence to point that climate change is happening. There have been various changing temperatures in different seasons all around the world. The rapid rate of melting ice caps and glaciers. The changing weather patterns leading to more severe natural disasters. .": 1,

How do you get global warming out of THAT?": 1,

                "there isn't really much evidence to prove that global warming is actually happening. Also if global warming was happening it doesn't matter because it won't affect any of us. And if global warming was happening the government would be taking steps to fix the problem so we don't have anything to worry about.": 1,

                "We've had weird weather, namely colder weather, which really is the opposite of global warming.  Plus, global warming is just a theory.  It hasn't been proven.  I think it's also a way for some companies to make money.": 1,
                "Scientists have claimed that carbon emissions have increased the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. This would trap heat and cause a general increase in temperature. That would explain the melting of the polar icecaps.": 1,

Everyone likes to make a big deal about something just to have something to talk about, and not to jump on the bandwagon. Next year, it will be eggs are bad for you again, and media will focus on the next new thing to get people all stirred up.": 1,

They would argue that the issue of a climare change is heavily skewed by politically motivated interest groups, such as environmentalists, for example. / Some of non-believers in climate change will try to bring into this debate their deeply rooted religious views. ": 1,
                "I don't think climate change is happening because the earth goes through natural swings of heating and cooling cycles.  These cycles takes thousands of years and can sometimes have interesting effects on the weather as well.  Humans are so insignificant, there is no way we could have affected the climate.": 1,
                "The world's climate has been changing since the beginning of time as far back as the dinosaurs. But things have also stayed the same.
