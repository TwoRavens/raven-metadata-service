If it is deemed right for us to promote wind and solar power, then we should do it of our own accord, not from some sense of self loathing where we allow the world to tell us what to do and guilt us into putting ourselves into a 3rd world status.  We are the world's leader, and it is time for us to take the role and stop deferring to other countries opinions and views.  Further, I believe that free market capitalism should determine which businesses succeed, not government corporate welfare. IF wind and solar can become viable options, they will succeed of their own merit. If they can't, they won't.  Our government needs to put money into things that truly matter and make a difference for US, not to please other countries or to set ourselves back so that other countries may advance.\"": 1,
