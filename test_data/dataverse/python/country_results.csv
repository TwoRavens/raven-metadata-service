None,His score was 25,His score was 25,Started slightly late because of computer issues,"If he wrote his reward was $9, he actually knew it was a $4 reward. He understood it but might not have put it in the computer right. Also, he told us his name was Steven, and I think I remember in the last experiment he said he was Jermey Grafton (I remember this because we doubted that he was a Harvard student).","Ian's computer froze for a minute, but it got going again. The participant only had to wait for a little while.","Sarah wrote the reward on the front of the page, so at a point she was no longer blind to conditions","Ian was 10 minutes late, hot, and sweaty from having just been running.","She didn't understand the anagram task, but she thought she lost because she messed up the directions. We decided that's probably ok since she still felt the experience of losing.",Didn't hand back the anagrams because Elizabeth thought she might have mixed them up,"English might not have been his first language, but he still did okay.","Although he got it in the end, he had a hard time understanding what an anagram was. On the whole he was a little slow understanding directions."

None,global warming is obvious and all reports on the news indicate that it is caused by humans and pollution,global warming is obvious and all reports on the news indicate that it is caused by humans and pollution,"The data collected by hundreds research papers published by peer-reviewed journals supports the hypothesis that human beings are the catalysts for global climate change.  Although all of the details concerning the mechanisms by which global weather and climate patterns change has not been elucidated, there is clear evidence from multiple line if inquiry that human activity is impacting global climate.  For example, ice cores from the arctic have measured CO2 levels over the past 10,000 years and found that the CO2 in our atmosphere has increased dramatically since the industrial revolution.  This is not just a \\""periodic fluctuation\""\"" and even when taking other confounding factors into account, there is no denying that we are the ones driving the change.""","Looking at the ice caps at the poles as they are melting and falling into the seas,the weather is changing across the world ,the winters are getting harder and the summers are getting hotter,we are about to loose some water supplies here in SW  USA and water will be scarce..... The climate IS changing!",Scientists are always making statements that later have to be retracted. / Mother Nature has natural cycles and global warming is one of them. / You can't trust what scientists say very much because they're always trying to get government grants. / Mother Nature has a way of straightening herself out. / ,People pollute too much. Oil companies aren't doing enough to clean their emissions. The ice caps are melting. ,"Most likely my colleagues would cite scientific papers and journal entries that denote the excessive carbon emissions over the last few centuries and the increased global climate change as being correlated to these readings. They may also use plain speech to convey that the nature of the problem is grave and requires all efforts to be slowed, however they also realize it's too late to completely reverse the effects of our CO2 emissions.",I think the conversation would steer towards it being a natural course of the world cycle. They would say man has no influence and that it is strictly hype in order to lead a democratic party agenda to regulate and profit of public fear. They would say the green house effect was created by fear mongers in the media and that our toxic emissions have little to no effect on the atmosphere.,"that scientists are not in agreement, and that science has changed over time. They would say that the data is inconclusive and that it is in the scientists interests to pretend that climate change is happening so that they can get government grants to study it.",Because there is visible evidence of warming and records indicate an increase in the average global temperature.,"From a cosmological perspective, the planet is just coming out of an ice age.  As the planet leaves that cycle, the temperatures will stabilize at a higher average than the over the last millennia, but there will be a stabilization."

He understood it but might not have put it in the computer right. Also, he told us his name was Steven, and I think I remember in the last experiment he said he was Jermey Grafton (I remember this because we doubted that he was a Harvard student).","Was not a native speaker, thought the anagrams were too hard to be true","Ian's computer froze for a minute, but it got going again. The participant only had to wait for a little while.","Not a native English speaker; misundertood (or claimed to) the taks, thought anagrams also had to be synonyms. Should probably exclude data.","Sarah wrote the reward on the front of the page, so at a point she was no longer blind to conditions","Ian was 10 minutes late, hot, and sweaty from having just been running.",He only actually got 1 right. We'll probably need to throw him out.,"She didn't understand the anagram task, but she thought she lost because she messed up the directions. We decided that's probably ok since she still felt the experience of losing."

I'm an artisan and I would make 30% more gold by choosing to build the road to the South vs to the North.  30% is a figure too large to ignore.,I like that both of the people get the same amount,I chose the road that would benefit both the farmers and artisans equally.,Was the more fair option and farming is probably more important.,"It was the most fair. Regardless of occupation, I felt that all memebers of my village should have an equal opportunity for increase.",We make equal amount. It is a win-win. ,It was only fair. If I was selfish and chose the road which would benefit be and not the farmers I would feel guilty and expect bad luck to come my way. I am choosing to take the high road (no pun intended).

Instead, Z here is calculated based on the mean effect size and its standard error.",95% confidence interval is now included.,You can now calculate meta-analysis based on Cohen's d (between subject) without converting d to r.,"Instead of weighting by sample size, meta-analysis of d uses inverse variance weighting."

None,My OSF:,My OSF:,The only modification I made in this version was to clarify the formula headings.,"This OSF also contains other relevant meta-analysis resources, so be sure check it out!",What is different about this template compared to the one I made for the SPPC mini meta article,This Excel template is a modification of my previous Excel mini meta template using guideline from David Wilson's book and website: http://mason.gmu.edu/~dwilsonb/ma.html,It is easier to add studies in this template.,"Z is no longer calculated in the Stouffer's method. Instead, Z here is calculated based on the mean effect size and its standard error.",95% confidence interval is now included.,You can now calculate meta-analysis based on Cohen's d (between subject) without converting d to r.,"Instead of weighting by sample size, meta-analysis of d uses inverse variance weighting."

Anne Pitcher. 2017. \Contingent Technocracy: Bureaucratic Independence in Developing Countries,\"" Journal of Public Policy. """,Description,"The dataset covers 29 countries in Africa from 1990-2007. Data collection included all countries on the African continent and several islands off the coast, that are included in conventional references to African countries.  Those countries for which legislation could not be found or for which data was judged to be mostly incomplete were excluded. Only the countries that the final sample analyzed are included in the dataverse file.", ,Coding Rules,"The guiding principles in coding are clear formal mandates regarding what the agency can and cannot do; what the chain of command is; who the agency answers to; how the personnel of the agency are selected; whether the agency has the responsibility to select; value; and sell SOEs for privatization.  Where the legislation is vague or does not address the expertise or responsibility of the agency, we left the cell blank. We do not assume that if something is not specified, it is forbidden or allowed (see Hanretty and Koop, 2011).  On the other hand, the lack of specificity in legislation suggests that there is room for political discretion.  Therefore, aspects of legislation must explicitly state what is allowed or forbidden in order to receive a score of 0 or 1.  See <Bureaucratic Independence Coding Rules.docx> for item-level coding rule details.",Variable Descriptions

""",see tab statepop_notes for variable descriptions. ,"see stateassembly_notes for governor party codes. Most observations are in even years, which Teele believes is probably the election year, so if Burnham lists the date as 1848, it is assumerd November 1848 was the election and that the new legislature took over in January the following year. By this logic, 1849 and 1850 represent one session year. Hence the value of 1 is added to the years before the dataset is expanded into an annual dataset.",A description of the coding process can be found in the online appendix.

None,global warming is obvious and all reports on the news indicate that it is caused by humans and pollution,global warming is obvious and all reports on the news indicate that it is caused by humans and pollution,"The data collected by hundreds research papers published by peer-reviewed journals supports the hypothesis that human beings are the catalysts for global climate change.  Although all of the details concerning the mechanisms by which global weather and climate patterns change has not been elucidated, there is clear evidence from multiple line if inquiry that human activity is impacting global climate.  For example, ice cores from the arctic have measured CO2 levels over the past 10,000 years and found that the CO2 in our atmosphere has increased dramatically since the industrial revolution.  This is not just a \\""periodic fluctuation\""\"" and even when taking other confounding factors into account, there is no denying that we are the ones driving the change.""","Looking at the ice caps at the poles as they are melting and falling into the seas,the weather is changing across the world ,the winters are getting harder and the summers are getting hotter,we are about to loose some water supplies here in SW  USA and water will be scarce..... The climate IS changing!",Scientists are always making statements that later have to be retracted. / Mother Nature has natural cycles and global warming is one of them. / You can't trust what scientists say very much because they're always trying to get government grants. / Mother Nature has a way of straightening herself out. / ,People pollute too much. Oil companies aren't doing enough to clean their emissions. The ice caps are melting. ,"Most likely my colleagues would cite scientific papers and journal entries that denote the excessive carbon emissions over the last few centuries and the increased global climate change as being correlated to these readings. They may also use plain speech to convey that the nature of the problem is grave and requires all efforts to be slowed, however they also realize it's too late to completely reverse the effects of our CO2 emissions.",I think the conversation would steer towards it being a natural course of the world cycle. They would say man has no influence and that it is strictly hype in order to lead a democratic party agenda to regulate and profit of public fear. They would say the green house effect was created by fear mongers in the media and that our toxic emissions have little to no effect on the atmosphere.,"that scientists are not in agreement, and that science has changed over time. They would say that the data is inconclusive and that it is in the scientists interests to pretend that climate change is happening so that they can get government grants to study it.",Because there is visible evidence of warming and records indicate an increase in the average global temperature.,"From a cosmological perspective, the planet is just coming out of an ice age.  As the planet leaves that cycle, the temperatures will stabilize at a higher average than the over the last millennia, but there will be a stabilization."

Having said that, the Croat incumbent of the SDP was the representative of a multi-ethnic party.","There are three sets of incumbents in the three ethnic segments. Though the moderate SDP gained seats from 5 to 8, the nationalist separatist Serbian SNSD and SDS also increased their seats to 8 and 4 respectively. It is difficult to tell whether these elections were a triumph for ethnic nationalists, or moderates. The ethnic breakdown is as follows. Bosniak: In the previous elections held in October 2006, the then Prime Minister Adnan's Terzic Party of Democratic Action (SDA) won nine seats, followed by the Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina (SBiH) with eight.  In 2010, the SDA took 7 seats while SBiH took 2.  Serb: In 2006 the Party of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in Serbia took seven seats while the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) took three seats. The SNSD election campaign demanded for a split of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia Herzegovina. In 2010 SNSD took 8 seats, the SDS took 4. This indicated an increase in nationalist, separatist sentiment in Serbia.  Croat: In 2006 the Croatian Democratic Union-Croatian National Union (HDZ-HNZ) took three seats. The Croatians Together (HDZ 1990), comprising dissidents of the HDZ, took two seats. In the 2010 campaign, the HDZ called for an autonomous region for Croats and was in a partnership with the Serbian SNSD to support each other's calls for greater independence. The 2010 results gave HDZ 3 seats, and HDZ 1990 2 seats (no change from 2006).  Moderate: The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDP), is the only major party that draws support from all three ethnicities: moderate Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. The SDP took 5 seats in 2006, and 8 seats in 2010. This potentially implied an advance for moderate parties, but was countered by the gains of Serbian nationalists.",anti-monarchical party gained seats,"While PAICV kept a majority, they lost 4 of 41 seats to the opposition.
