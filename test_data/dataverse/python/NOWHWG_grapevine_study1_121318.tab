Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional.

If Trump is to do what he said he would, he needs to get his programs running so that we can see the 3 percent growth in GDP he promised.": 1,

We both agree that so called president Trump is a hot head and I think we'll likely see some of military action either in the middle east or east Asia as a distraction from his Russian collusion investigation. This will bring the markets down and productivity will be stifled so the current data is very fragile.": 1,

                "The economy has picked up slightly but not at the rate that the President was hoping for. The overall spending in teh economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter. We still had a lot of work ahead of ourselves before the president could reach his goal and that this was only going to happen if we agreed to work together.": 1,

                "GDP growth has increased slightly to 1.4 % in the first quarter of 2017. This very modest increase is thought to be due to higher consumer spending and an increase in exports. It is still a far cry from the fast 3% growth promised by Trump. A sustained  GDP growth of 3 % has not been seen since the 1990s. Average GDP growth is around 2% over the last several years.": 1,
                "While the the estimate was revised upward, it seems that it is still a ways away from the 3% target of the administration, and is below the historical average.  With his agenda seemingly stalled, how do you think the President is going to get the nations economy humming again?": 1,

President Trump is giving tax cuts for major businesses, which have been exporting a lot more. Consumers have also affected the GDP by spending more than usual. Although their is some growth, it is much smaller than what the US has done in the best and these trade deals could prove to be valuable for the future of our economy.": 1,

It is growing slightly faster than originally estimated, at 1.4\\% in this 2nd quarter, but that is still pretty far from Trump's goal of 3\\%. A lot of the programs he proposed to get there have yet to become a reality. Also exports and businesses did pretty well last quarter. Consumer is up a little bit as well. ": 1,

However, growth is still relatively low and the economic moves Trump intended to make in regulations, taxes, and elsewehre, haven't happened yet, and aren't yet being reflected in teh economy, even in anticipation.

A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate.

President Trump is giving tax cuts for major businesses, which have been exporting a lot more. Consumers have also affected the GDP by spending more than usual. Although their is some growth, it is much smaller than what the US has done in the best and these trade deals could prove to be valuable for the future of our economy.": 1,
                "Despite the fact that the President's plan to speed up economic growth has not been quite as fast as had been predicted, it does seem that consumer spending is rising a little and I think that is because of consumer optimism that the plan is working. Even though slower than expected. There also seems to be some disappointing news in regard to manufacturing production but these things take time and I believe will occur in the long run.": 1,

Under the current administration, our sales are dropping our cousin living is rising, we are feeling and many parts in the and ministration that we need to advance our country. Logically the right or the left isn't thinking clearly. Our president needs to step down and quit lying to us about these ratings that are false, bigoted, and delusional. Number 45 said he would bring jobs back to America and he hasn't even put his pinky on it, he's more worried about building a wall and spitting in the face of our transgender Military men and women that have given their lives for us.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to remain unchanged at a 1.2 percent rate.\\n\\nGDP for the January-March period tends to underperform relative to the rest of the year due to perennial issues with the calculation of the data the government has said it is working to resolve.\\n\\nFirst-quarter economic growth was boosted by an upward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent rate instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent pace. It was still the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013.\\n\\nDespite the upward revision, the Trump administration's stated target of swiftly boosting U.S. growth to 3 percent remains a challenge.\\n\\nA sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate. The U.S. economy expanded 1.6 percent in 2016, the lowest rate in five years.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground five months into his presidency.\\n\\nInitial signs that economic growth re-accelerated sharply in the second quarter have also faltered with recent disappointing data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation. Housing data has also been mixed. The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently forecasts annualized GDP growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter.\\n\\nExports in the first quarter were revised to show a gain of 7.0 percent from the previously reported 5.8 percent.\\nBusiness spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a 7.8 percent rate in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated.\\n\\nBusinesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, rather than the $4.3 billion reported last month.

People believe in President Trump and are more optimistic about the country and their lives since he took office. While a sustained growth of 3\\% hasn't been seen since the 1990s, that is one of President Trump's goals and the people are behind him and believe it's possible for him to deliver because of his stated goals of rolling back regulations that were harming businesses and implementing tax cuts to help both businesses and people.": 1,

A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate.

The administration's projections of 3\\% growth seem foolhardy and doomed to fail. That rate of economic growth hasn't been seen since the 1990s. Other economic indicators were mixed.": 1,
                "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1,
                "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others. Seriously, considering the turmoil the country has been in over the course of the past 5 months it's surprising the economy is doing as well as it is.": 1,

Considering the law decade, this might be the new normal, the years of 3% economic growth seem to be a thing of the past. Trump hasn't delivered a single one of his economic promises so far.": 1,

The overall spending in the economy by the consumer is up and that is one of the major reasons why there was a slight uptick in the economy this last quarter.

                "It looks like the economy has seen a boost in the second quarter, but it is less strong than both anticipated and Trump's promises. Retail and manufacturing are down, while consumer spending is up. The goal is 3\\% increase, but it's 1.7\\%.": 1,

                "The US economy was better in the first quarter than expected due to higher consumer spending and in increase in exports. Good but still the slowest quarter in a year. We have a long way to go to meet Trumps expectations of 3\\% growth which hasn't been seen since the 1990's. ": 1,
                "What the president said about the economy was wrong, and he hasn't done anything yet to help the economy. Instead he has been embroiled in controversy after controversy, and his inability to control himself for one thing is very unnerving.  He has no previous experience in government and it shows. He is worthless in my opinion.": 1,

We both agree that so called president Trump is a hot head and I think we'll likely see some of military action either in the middle east or east Asia as a distraction from his Russian collusion investigation. This will bring the markets down and productivity will be stifled so the current data is very fragile.": 1,

He hasn't been able to implement successfully his economic program, and as a result, the country's economic growth is stunted. What do you believe needs to be done to stimulate economic growth? Is it your opinion that the President and his administration will be able to formulate and successfully enact a plan?": 1,
                "You can't always expect a consistent growth rate all of the time. There are going ot be slow times so don't be so worried when teh economy slows down. The government should try to stay out of influencing the economy so that it might improve.": 1,

                "While that sounds positive, I don't know if its something Trump can take credit for. It is probably left over of the Obama administration. And Trump's goal of 3\\% is unrealistic considering he doesn't even have a tax proposal yet.": 1,
                "The article seemed to indicate the economy is slightly better off in some areas with growth lagging behind in others. Seriously, considering the turmoil the country has been in over the course of the past 5 months it's surprising the economy is doing as well as it is.": 1,

                "It seems that our economy is slowly getting back to a good place despite having so many issues and roadblocks by the Democrats. Even though it's slow going, and not as fast as PResident Trump predicted, it is still going in a postive direction.": 1,

                "Business growth has not been as projected the past few month. Though the United States economic growth rate has stopped reaching the peak which it achieved in the 1990s. Most key indicator including housing, manufacturing, export..shows there is a slow but steady increase, but not at the level that has been as propserous as the past.": 1,

                "The economy handed to Trump by Obama was in poor shape. Trump and his cabinet are doing a lot to stimulate the economy but it will take long to show fruit. Blaming Trump for the current economy is very unfair since he's only been in office a very sthort time but Democrats will say anything to drag him down. Whether Trump's economic policy is a success will show in the next few years.": 1,

                "We've had our first opportunity to see how the economy has performed under the Trump Administration.  I think that it's really too soon to tell how much of this report is due to Trump's performance/influence on the market, and how much might be a hold-over from 2016.  I will be much more interested in seeing his 2nd quarter numbers, and then, down the road, any year-over-year numbers that emerge, as a way of really assessing what Trump's impact on the economy really is.": 1,

                "Apparently gdp went up more than expected in the first quarter, mainly due to increases in consumer spending. But we could have a discussion on whether consumer spending and gdp growth is really what we're looking for. I wonder about the environmental impacts of that. Other indicators were a little more or less than expected.": 1,
                "I think the economy did not grow as great as it supposed to be. Obama did a better job trying to build the economy this past few years and I certainly hope Trump did not destroy it in one year. I haven't seen anything that can make US great again.": 1,

                "I think it's still too early to say whether or not Trump will make an impact on our economy o rnot. He has so much on his plate with so many issues I wouldn't make a hard-pressed decision on what I think of him as a President.": 1,
                "I have recently read an article about the economy of US after trump presidency. It is not that much satisfactory. The growth is very less as compared to first quarter. All because of presidents economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending. It is not good for US economy. We do not feel any good growth in his 5 months of presidency.": 1,

                "The economy is growing at a sluggish pace, it's nothing fantastic but at the same time it is growing. Considering the law decade, this might be the new normal, the years of 3% economic growth seem to be a thing of the past. Trump hasn't delivered a single one of his economic promises so far.": 1,

                "The economy is doing resonably well. there is some weakness in retail and manufacturing, but that has a lot to do with long term secular (vs cyclical shifts) in the economy. the improvement qtr over qtr is minor but things are basically moving along as they have been over the past few years.": 1,

                "Trump's goal of a 3 percent GDP gain annually is unrealistic and hasn't been seen in nearly 20 years.
